PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this policy is to outline general cleaning and disinfection principles to maintain a 
clean, sanitary, and safe environment. 
 
POLICY: 
All patient care areas and hospital equipment will be cleaned and disinfected on 
a routine basis.  This is a two-step process: clean first, then disinfect. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
Cleaning and Disinfection 
• Wash hands- and put-on gloves. 
• Remove any soiled linens (see below) and trash, if necessary. 
• Wash hands- and put-on new gloves (see below for more information on glove use). 
• All interior and exterior surfaces of items must be cleaned. 
• All movable and removable parts must be inspected for visible soilage.  For example, 
open doors, drawers, and compartments, lift cushions, lift head rests/footrests, and turn 
mattresses over, inspect wheels, etc. 
• Dust and crumbs must be removed by wiping or vacuuming. 
• Clean all visible soilage with a general-purpose cleaner or disinfectant cleaner or 
towelette. Disinfectants are ineffective if there is dirt or visible soilage present. 
• Once visible soilage has been removed, apply disinfectant to all contaminated surfaces.  
See individual department policies for cleaning specific equipment.  Follow 
manufacturer’s recommendations for contact time. For commonly used hospital 
disinfectant, see table below. 
• Clean from areas that are cleanest and work toward areas that are dirtiest. 
• Do not re-use soiled cleaning rags. 
• Allow disinfectant to fully dry before putting clean linens, drapes, or supplies back on 
surface.

Glove Use 
• Wear gloves when handling soiled items or blood/body fluids. 
• Once soiled items have been disposed of, remove gloves, and wash hands or use alcohol 
foam if not visibly soiled. 
• Change gloves if they become soiled. Never wash and/or reuse gloves. 
• Wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand rub between glove changes 
and after glove use.   
 
Handling Soiled Linens 
• Wear gloves to handle soiled linens. 
• When linens are removed from beds or stretchers, place into linen bags before transport 
to the Soiled Utility Room. 
• Linen should be rolled into the center of the bed or stretcher.  Do not shake linens. 
• Do not carry soiled linens close to the body. 
• Remove gloves and wash hands after bagging and placing into linen hamper.  Put on a 
clean pair of gloves to continue with room cleaning or patient care, if required.  
• Do not place linen in red biohazard bags, even when saturated with 
blood or body fluids. Linens that are saturated should be placed into 
clear plastic bags before placing into the soiled linen hamper to keep 
from leakage.
