PURPOSE:   
To establish a standardized approach to drawing blood for culture from the various aged patients encountered 
at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center  
 
Addresses: 
Supervisors 
Venipuncture Charge Techs 
Phlebotomists 
 
PRINCIPAL: 
Bacteria which enter the blood stream (bacteremia) can quickly spread throughout the body and cause severe 
illness.  Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia is determined by culturing blood samples taken from the patient 
suspected of having a bacteria present in their blood stream.  The culturing of a blood sample requires attention 
to technique during all stages of the collection process to avoid misinterpretation of results.  Appropriate 
volumes of blood that are properly collected and combined with culture media enhance the probability of 
isolation of the bacteria responsible for the bacteremia.   
 
It is recommended that two blood culture collection sets be drawn from a patient in order to determine 
bacteremia.  One blood culture collection consists of a volume of blood taken from a single venipuncture site 
and then inoculated into an aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottle.  Since the collection of an adequate 
blood volume is the single most important factor in detecting bacteria in the blood stream, the more blood 
cultured, the more likely a culture will be positive for bacteria circulating in the blood stream.  An optimum 
volume of 20 mls of collected blood per set is recommended for adults having blood cultured. Blood volumes 
required for patients weighing 37 Kg (81.5 pounds) or less are determined by the patient’s weight.     
 
Precautions: 
A. The ChloraPrep One-Step FREPP Applicator may not be used: 
1. On children less than 2 months of age 
2. On patients with allergies or sensitivity to chlorhexidine or isopropyl alcohol 
3. On open skin wounds 
B. The +PDI Povidine-Iodine Cleansing Scrub Swabstick (1’s) is used on children of less than 2 months of 
age 
• Ask the parent or patient nurse if a history of allergy to iodine exists before beginning the skin 
disinfection procedure 
• Procedure for cleaning draw sites when patients are allergic or sensitive to iodine  
• Gather a +PDI Castille Soap Towelette.

• Open the towelette and cleanse the phlebotomy site to remove any visible soil from the skin 
• Gather two isopropyl alcohol preps  
• Open the first isopropyl alcohol prep and scrub the phlebotomy site with the isopropyl alcohol 
prep for 30 seconds 
• Allow phlebotomy site to air dry 
• Repeat the procedure with a second isopropyl alcohol prep 
• Allow the phlebotomy site to air dry 
• Do not use the iodine tincture prep to clean the draw site 
 
1. Non-allergic patients – follow directions noted in the procedure  
• Gather a +PDI Castille Soap Towelette. 
• Open the towelette and cleanse the phlebotomy site to remove any visible soil from the skin 
• Gather a 2X2 gauze to dry the phlebotomy site (it may be necessary to repeat the step with the 
castile towelette if soil is visible when drying with the gauze)  
• Open the +PDI Povidine-Iodine Cleansing Scrub Swabstick (1’s) and remove the Swabstick 
• Place the swabstick on the intended draw site.  Clean an area approximately two inches in 
diameter by moving the swab outward in concentric circles.  
• Allow to air dry  
C. Blood cultures are to be drawn from central venous catheters only if requested by the physician. 
D. Vascular catheters are to be cleaned and cleared of contaminating material before inoculating blood 
culture bottles by nursing personnel as follows: 
1. Scrub central venous catheter hub with the first alcohol prep for 15 seconds using a second hand or 
stopwatch and allow to air dry 
2. Scrub the hub again using a second alcohol prep for 15 seconds and allow to air dry 
3. Using sterile technique, connect the collection syringe to the catheter port and use the two-syringe 
discard method to collect the sample 
E. Clear vascular catheters of contaminating material by using a two-syringe discard method 
1. Nursing personnel access the catheter and withdraw a minimum of 5 ml of blood 
2. This first syringe sample is not used for inoculation of blood culture bottles 
3. Nursing personnel access the catheter a second time using a second sterile syringe 
4. The second sample collected in the second syringe is used to fill the blood culture bottles 
5. The first collected syringe may be used to collect blood samples from Oncology patients, or if 
specifically ordered by the physician  
F. Do not force blood into the blood culture bottle by applying pressure to the plunger of the syringe.  
Forcing blood into the bottle may cause overfilling and resultant build up of positive air pressure.  
Positive bottle pressure may result in aerosol formation with the patient’s blood and/or cause the 
stopper to be forced out of the bottle creating an infection hazard for the phlebotomist and the 
laboratory worker. 
G. Recollection of blood cultures is to be minimized due to the possibility of patients receiving antibiotics 
in the intervening time required for recollection.  Antibiotics present in the collected sample may 
inhibit bacterial growth. 
H. Yellow Pediatric bottles are not to be used for culturing suboptimum sample collections   
 
Materials: 
1. Blood culture site prep kits – used to clean the phlebotomy site prior to sample collection 
• ChloraPrep One-Step FREPP Applicator 
2. +PDI Castille Soap Towelette

4. Blood collection bottles 
• Aerobic bottle selection is weight dependent 
• Bottles are ready for use - no additives needed 
• Store bottles at room temperature (15-30˚C), protect from direct sunlight                                      
• Do not use bottles if broth is cloudy, the sensor on the bottom of the bottle is yellow or the 
bottle cracked

Blood Culture Collection 
1. Timing of specimen collection 
1. Blood cultures may be ordered as timed collections. 
2. When more than 1 blood culture is ordered and no time interval is specified, they are drawn 5 
minutes apart 
3. Blood cultures may be drawn at specified intervals when determining the presence of continuous 
bacteremia in patients with endocarditis or other endovascular infections.  
2. Number of blood cultures 
1. When the physician orders blood cultures to be drawn, two sets of cultures will be ordered and 
drawn from separately prepared sites, unless the physician order specifies that only one blood 
culture set is to be drawn.  
2. When the physician orders blood cultures and the patient have a central line, both sets of blood 
cultures should be drawn peripherally from two different sites.  A physician may occasionally 
request a sample be taken from the central line for culture.  A sample collected from a line draw 
should be paired with a peripherally drawn blood culture to assist in test interpretation in the event 
of a positive result. 
3. Pediatric patients with a central line will have one culture drawn from the central line and one 
drawn from a peripheral site.   
3. Recommended blood collection volumes for culture 
1. For patients weighing 37 Kg (81.5 pounds) or more, the recommended blood volume collection for 
each blood culture set is 20 ml (10 ml placed in the aerobic and 10 ml placed in the anaerobic 
bottle). 
2. For pediatric patients weighing less than 37 Kg (81.5 pounds), a weight-based blood volume is 
collected.  Refer to the table below for the required volume of blood per kilogram (pound) of body 
weight. 
3. Anaerobic bottles are drawn on pediatric patients when requested by the physician. 
4. Sample collection volumes may vary due to the patient’s condition and difficulty encountered in 
performing the venipuncture.  Recommended collection volumes are as noted:

5. Suboptimum specimen volumes (when collected blood volumes are less than the noted required 
sample volume) are discouraged as inadequate volumes of blood may compromise the recovery of 
potentially life-threatening organisms from the patient's blood 
6. Suboptimum specimen volumes may be rejected for culturing by Microbiology personnel 
7. The collection of suboptimum specimen volumes: 
• Assess the possibility of redrawing the patient to obtain an acceptable volume of blood for 
culture 
• Redraw the patient collecting an acceptable volume of blood 
• If unable to collect an acceptable volume of blood 
o Fill the green or yellow aerobic bottle to the acceptable sample volume 
o Place the remaining specimen volume in the orange anaerobic bottle 
• If unable to collect a specimen of sufficient volume to fill a green or yellow aerobic bottle   
o Fill the green or yellow aerobic bottle with the entire suboptimum sample volume   
8. Blood culture bottles are to be filled immediately following specimen collection and before other 
blood collection tubes are filled

• Site contamination could lead to a specimen being determined positive when a clinically 
relevant isolate is not actually present 
• Open Steripath package and remove the device by pulling up on the transfer adapter while placing a finger 
on the tray (Caution:  Ensure the winged needle and transfer adapter are securely attached to the diversion 
device) 
• Perform venipuncture following standard procedure (Caution: Perform venipuncture before  
             performing activating Steripath.  Diversion will not occur if Steripath is activated prior to 
             venipuncture) 
• Actuate (gently squeeze) the device with slow and steady pressure to divert the initial specimen  
     of blood into the diversion chamber.  Monitor the blood flow into the diversion changer:  Open 
     circle- diversion step has not started, Half-full circle – half-way through actuation, Full circle-  
     actuation is complete, check mark-diversion chamber is closed, and second sterile blood flow 
path is opened. 
• After confirmation of complete diversion, continue to apply pressure until a “click” is heard and  
     the check mark icon is reached.  The initial specimen is now captured, and the system is ready 
for blood culture sample collection. 
• Transferring the collected specimen to blood culture bottles 
• Insert the aerobic blood culture bottle into the transfer device adapter and set on a flat surface to  
     aid in collecting an optimal sample volume and to avoid bottle overfilling.  Collect anaerobic

Reporting Results: 
Blood culture results are reported by Microbiology personnel 
 
Limitations of the Procedure: 
• Inoculating vacutainer tubes for other lab testing prior to inoculating blood culture bottles may result in 
contamination of the culture 
• Improper cleaning of the venipuncture site may lead to blood culture contamination 
• Delay in transport of the inoculated blood culture bottles to the lab may delay or impede detection of 
bacterial growth 
• Over filling of blood culture bottles with specimen may lead to false negative cultures due to improper 
blood to broth ratios 
• Under filling of blood culture bottles with specimen may lead to false negative results 
• Certain strains of H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, and P. anaerobius may be sensitive to the 
anticoagulant SPS found in the blood culture bottle which may result in a lack of growth or low production 
of CO2 by these strains if an insufficient amount of blood is inoculated into the culture bottles  
• Organisms are often few in number and may appear intermittently in the blood stream; therefore, 
consecutive blood samples should be collected from each patient 
• Collecting acceptable specimens for blood culture is dependent upon the quality of the preparation of the 
phlebotomy site.  Improper preparation of the phlebotomy site may result in specimen contamination and 
the resultant recovery of bacteria contaminates normally found on skin.  Inadequate specimen volume, 
inappropriate choice of blood culture bottles, and delays in specimen arrival in the Microbiology lab may 
adversely affect culture results. 
• Use of expired blood culture tubes will adversely affect test results
