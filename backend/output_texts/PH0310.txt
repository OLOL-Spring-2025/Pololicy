PURPOSE: 
To provide standardized medication safety policies for “high alert” medications identified by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices 
(ISMP). 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
High-alert Medications:  medications that bear a higher risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error. 
 
Independent double check:  for the purpose of this policy, shall mean two authorized personnel separately checking the accuracy of the 
following against the prescriber’s order. 
 
Authorized prescriber:  for the purpose of this policy, “authorized prescriber” shall mean a practitioner recognized by Our Lady of the 
Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) as having privileges to write orders for medications within the scope of their clinical practice at 
OLOL.

i. Chemotherapy 
i. Vinca alkaloids 
1. Vincristine 
2. Vinblastine 
3. Vinorelbine 
ii. Methotrexate 
 
II. The following methods shall be utilized, where appropriate, to prevent harm associated with the use of high-alert 
medications: 
a. Development of order sets, pre-printed order forms, and protocols to standardize prescribing and monitoring 
b. Use of standardized concentrations, dosage strengths, and dosage forms to minimize variability 
c. Use of pre-mixed and unit-dosed medications whenever possible 
d. Use of programmable pumps to administer continuous and intermittent infusions 
e. Perform independent double checks after preparation and prior to administration 
i. Factors to be identified during the independent double check include 1. Right patient identification per our organization’s policy 
2. Right drug (verified against current order) 
3. Right dose of drug (verified against current order and infusion pump; mathematical calculations, 
strength or concentration must be verified) 
4. Right route of administration 
5. Right time of administration 
f. Limit prescriptive authority to authorized providers 
g. Restrict the use of certain high-alert medications to appropriate nursing units 
h. Utilize barcode scans during the following medication processes (where automation present): IV compounding, 
repackaging, dispensing, loading and refilling in automated dispensing cabinets  
i. All defined “High Alert” medications should be labeled as such in the Electronic Medical Record in a face up manner 
to the administering provider 
j. Limit the storage of high-alert medications to areas with personnel trained for safe preparation and administration. 
III. Readers of this policy should refer to the attached High Alert Restrictions reference document for detailed instructions for
