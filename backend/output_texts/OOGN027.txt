PURPOSE 
The purpose of this policy is to assure that all online Patient Education information that is given 
to a patient is captured in the electronic medical record.(EMR)  
 
POLICY 
1. Patient online education material is selected from a third-party vendor, HealthWise who has 
been chosen to be the source for patient education. The educational material becomes a part 
of the EMR. At the time of discharge, educational material is printed or embedded into the 
After Visit Summary (AVS) which is provided to the patient. In addition, patients can access 
this AVS in their MyChart account.  
 
2. Pre-printed brochures, pamphlets, and other additional resources are not considered to be 
online Patient Education handouts.
