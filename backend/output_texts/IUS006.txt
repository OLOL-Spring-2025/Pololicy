PURPOSE: 
 To outline guidelines for performing endovaginal ultrasound procedures in the 
department. 
POLICY: 
A. Endovaginal exams will be performed at the radiologist's discretion and at 
the referring physician's request on per case basis. 
B. In those cases requiring endovaginal imaging, the technique and procedure 
will be explained to the patient. 
1. With the patient's informed verbal consent, the patient will be 
instructed to totally void and return to the imaging suite. 
2. She will then be asked to insert the probe as she would a tampon. 
3. If the patient is willing to undergo the endovaginal exam, but is 
hesitant to insert the probe, the technologist, a female attendant, 
radiologist, or the patient's attending physician (if he/she is 
available) will be needed to insert probe. 
4. The endovaginal probe will be covered with a sheath.  
5. An appropriate lubricant will be applied to the probe both for the 
patient's safety and comfort. 
6. The probe will also be disinfected between uses as per the 
hospital's policy and the manufacture's specifications. 
                                   C.  A female attendant will be in the imaging suite during the entire 
 procedure.
