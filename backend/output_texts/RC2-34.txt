PURPOSE: 
 
The purpose of this policy is to outline the utilization of VELETRI at Our Lady of the Lake Regional 
Medical Center.  
 
Inhaled VELETRI (Epoprostenol Sodium) will be administered as a first-line therapy in adults in lieu of 
Inhaled Nitric Oxide as a selective pulmonary vasodilator. Inhaled Nitric Oxide will be a secondary therapy 
only after a failed VELETRI trial.  CVL (cardiovascular lab) and OR (operating room) will be the 
exception to this process as diagnostic use of Nitric Oxide will be allowed for these cases.   
 
Inhaled VELETRI may be administered for the following clinical conditions: 
 
1. Clinical evidence of hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2 < 55mmHg with FIO2 > 0.60,  
  OI >25 x 4 hours) 
2. Pulmonary Hypertension - Clinical evidence of elevated pulmonary artery pressures (mean PAP > 
30 mmHg) or elevated pulmonary vascular resistance  
3. Right Ventricular (RV) Failure in the absence of valve disease 
.  
Respiratory Therapists (RT) will administer and wean the dosage of the Inhaled VELETRI. The ordering 
physician may choose to follow the VELETRI protocol, which can be found in Epic.  The protocol will 
enable weaning/discontinuance of Inhaled VELETRI once a response has been established or when patients 
do not respond to therapy.
