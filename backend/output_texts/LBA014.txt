CLINICAL PATHOLOGY/CORE LAB 
Core Lab will move all manually ordered test(s) to a computer order within 72 hours.  
Exceptions are documented by adding a follow-up task in Epic and resolved by Outreach 
Daily (M-F business work day) 
 
When a test is ordered by a physician that is not orderable in EPIC: 
• The order is placed in the computer system as a Laboratory Manual Order, with the 
test name entered at the prompt.  If Lab receives the order on a Manual Requisition 
(paper order) in the Core Lab, Outreach Processing, Referrals staff, or core lab staff 
will enter the Laboratory Manual Order in the computer system. 
• The order is written on the Manual Charge sheet with the following information: 
1. Patient name 
2. Medical Record Number 
3. Date of Service 
4. Test name 
5. CPT codes 
6. Test cost from Reference Lab 
7. If culture: source/site 
• The Manual Charge sheet is given to Outreach Director daily (M-F business work 
day) for appropriate billing.

   Tissue Bank in the computer or on manual form if specially ordered.  If a  
   special ordered product was ordered on a case-by-case basis and used, the tissue  
   will be manually charged the following working day by designated personnel or  
   supervisory personnel.  
 
• MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES CHARGES (TRANSFUSION SERVICE

   charges by qualified personnel.  Patient antibody workups performed by  
   reference laboratories, the purchase of rare donor blood and transportation of  
   blood and blood products by yellow cab require manual charge entry.

training by reviewing the order protocol as competency documentation which includes: 
who may order tests, type of tests, duplicate testing, cancelling tests, request for credits,
