Policy: 
 
From a clinical assessment standpoint, it would be preferable for a patient to perform a graded exercise test 
prior to entry into cardiac rehabilitation program. However, it is the decision of the referring physician whether 
a patient will perform a graded exercise test (GXT) before beginning cardiac rehabilitation.  
 
An initial exercise prescription may be generated with or without a recent GXT. If a patient does not perform a 
GXT prior to entry, the initial exercise prescription will be formulated using information from the initial 
assessments. The Duke Activity Status Index and a 6 Minute Walk Test will be used as an estimate of 
functional capacity. Initial heart rate zone will be set at Resting Heart Rate plus 20 -30 beats. Ratings of 
Perceived Exertion on the 20 point Borg Scale should remain below 15 (hard).
