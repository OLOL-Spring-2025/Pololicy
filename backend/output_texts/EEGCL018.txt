Purpose:  
The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for obtaining after hour’s stat EEG 
testing and to define what constitutes a stat order.  
Policy: 
AWhen a STAT EEG is ordered, an EEG tech may only be called out for the possibility of 
nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), where it could affect immediate management and 
possible patient outcomes. It is the responsibility of the ordering physician (if a non-neurologist) 
to arrange a timely reading with an interpreting neurologist (This reading should normally be 
completed in 2-4 hours, from completion of the test).  STAT EEG “call reports” will only be 
given to a neurologist.   
 
Procedure: 
 
 
1. If ordered after hours, as described in policy EEG-001, hours (1630 on weekdays, 
weekends and holidays) the ordering physician will be asked to clarify the purpose of the STAT 
EEG (as possible NCSE).  and who the interpreting neurologist of the STAT EEG will be.  The 
interpreting neurologist will be notified by the EEG technician when the EEG has been 
completed.  The EEG technician will confirm concern of possible NCSE from the ordering 
physician or nurse. For suspected NCSE, the attending physician for the patient will be directed 
to contact the neurologist on call to arrange for a reading and to confirm STAT EEG is indicated. 
Once the STAT EEG has been completed, the EEG technician will only notify the neurologist on 
call.  If NCSE is not suspected, the EEG will be completed on the next business day.
