PURPOSE: 
 
To insure that communicable disease processes are appropriately and consistently managed in a 
confidential and non-discriminatory manner. 
 
POLICY: 
 
1. Department Heads and/or Supervisors will report to Employee Health Department any employee 
who is diagnosed presumptively or confirmed to have any condition as listed on the attached 
Infectious Disease list. 
 
2. Reported potentially infectious disease processes among the employee population will be assessed 
and a plan of action will be formulated in a collaborative/consultative manner.  Decisions for the 
well-being and safety of the employee and other populations will be made in concert between the 
employee, the employee's physician, the employee health nurs e, Infection Control , Risk 
Management, the Department Head, and Administration.  Consultation will be sought from other 
appropriate physicians (i.e. Infectious Disease specialist), the Department of Human Resources, 
and the community agencies such as the local Department of Public Health.  If applicable, the 
Recommendations for Health-Care Personnel infected with Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, 
and Human Immunodeficiency Virus form will be utilized.  
 
3. All employees returning to work due to an infection with a communicable disease will report to the 
Employee Health Department prior to the start of the work shift and will complete the return to 
work assessment requirements. 
 
4. Employees exposed to patients or co -workers with communicable illness while at work will 
complete an Employee Safety Event report, and contact Employee Health for an evaluation. For 
Blood and Body Fluid Exposures, the employee should contact the Lake Line Direct nurse 
navigator immediately. 
 
Infectious Diseases Requiring Work Restrictions or Prophylaxis: 
 
Employees Exposed to Communicable Diseases Outside of Work :  Any employee who is exposed to a 
contagious illness or has symptoms of a contagious illness will contact Employee Health for an 
assessment, and work restrictions will be applied according to the specific diseases or illness using the 
CDC Guidelines (see table below)  
 
Employees Exposed to Communicable Diseases While at Work:  Employees exposed to infectious patients 
or co-workers during work hours must complete an Employee Safety Event report and contact Employee 
Health for assessment and follow -up.  If prophylaxis is warranted, the employee will be sent to the  
Emergency Care Unit for a prescription. The prescription should be taken to the Medical Plaza Pharmacy 
and will be filled at no charge to the employee.  Work restrictions will be applied according to the table below.  Any employee who declines the recommended prophylaxis will be required to sign a declination 
statement in Employee Health. If any signs and symptoms of illness develop, the employee must contact 
Employee Health for evaluation and work restrictions will be applied according to the table below.

The system for categorizing recommendations is as follows: 
Category 1A=Strongly recommended for all hospitals and strongly supported by well-designed experimental or 
epidemiologic studies. 
Category 1B=Strongly recommended for all hospitals and reviewed as effective by experts in the field and a 
consensus of Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee members based on strong rationale and 
suggestive evidence, even though definitive scientific studies have not been done. 
Category 11=Suggested for implementation in many hospitals.  Recommendations may be supported by 
suggestive clinical or epidemiologic studies, a strong theoretical rationale, or definitive studies applicable to 
some, but not all, hospitals. 
No Recommendation, Unresolved Issue = Practices for which insufficient evidence or consensus regarding 
efficacy exists.

Attachment: Recommendations for Health-Care Personnel infected with Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C 
Virus, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Recommendations for Health-Care Personnel infected with 
Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, and Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus 
Summary:  
Health-Care Personnel infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and/or Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may have their job assignments restricted from participating in certain exposure-
prone procedures as defined by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Employee Health, 
Infection Control, and an expert review panel will review and recommend work restrictions, if applicable, while 
maintaining employee confidentiality. 
 
CDC classification of exposure-prone patient care procedures: 
Category I. Procedures known or likely to pose 
an increased risk of percutaneous injury to a 
health-care provider that have resulted in 
provider-to-patient transmission of hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) 
     These procedures are limited to major 
abdominal, cardiothoracic, and orthopedic surgery, 
repair of major traumatic injuries, abdominal and 
vaginal hysterectomy, caesarean section, vaginal 
deliveries, and major oral or maxillofacial surgery 
(e.g., fracture reductions). Techniques that have 
been demonstrated to increase the risk for health-
care provider percutaneous injury and provider-to-
patient blood exposure include 
• digital palpation of a needle tip in a body cavity 
and/or 
• the simultaneous presence of a health care 
provider’s fingers and a needle or other sharp 
instrument or object (e.g., bone spicule) in a 
poorly visualized or highly confined anatomic 
site. 
     Category I procedures, especially those that 
have been implicated in HBV transmission, are not 
ordinarily performed by students fulfilling the 
essential functions of a medical or dental school 
education. 
Category II. All other invasive and noninvasive 
procedures. 
     These and similar procedures are not included in 
Category I as they pose low or no risk for percutaneous 
injury to a health-care provider or, if a percutaneous injury 
occurs, it usually happens outside a patient’s body and 
generally does not pose a risk for provider-to-patient blood 
exposure. These include 
• surgical and obstetrical/gynecological procedures that 
do not involve the techniques listed in Category I; 
• the use of needles or other sharp devices when the 
health-care provider’s hands are outside a body cavity 
(e.g., phlebotomy, placing and maintaining peripheral 
and central intravascular lines, administering 
medication by injection, performing needle biopsies, or 
lumbar puncture); 
• dental procedure other than major oral or maxillofacial 
surgery; 
• insertion of tubes (e.g., nasogastric, endotracheal, 
rectal, or urinary catheters); 
• endoscopic or bronchoscopic procedures; 
• internal examination with a gloved hand that does not 
involve the use of sharp devices (e.g., vaginal, oral, and 
rectal examination; and 
• procedures that involve external physical touch (e.g., 
general physical or eye examinations or blood pressure 
checks). 
Source:  CDC Recommendations for the Management of Hepatitis B Virus -infected Health-Care Providers and 
Students. MMWR July 6, 2012; 61 (No. 3). Recommendations: 
There will be no restrictions to health-care personnel infected with HBV, HCV, and HIV that perform 
exposure-prone procedures listed in Category II. These conditions in health-care providers and 
students who do not perform invasive exposure-prone procedures should be managed as a personal 
health issue. Therefore, it is expected that health-care providers will annually attest to the Employee 
Health office the status of their medical follow-up with their personal physician. Standard Precautions 
must be observed which shall include: 
• Hand washing 
• Proper  use of personal protective equipment 
• Use of safer needle devices 
• No recapping of needles/proper disposal of needles and other sharp instruments 
• Refrain from direct patient care and the handling of equipment/devices used in performing invasive 
procedures if have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis until condition is resolved 
• Proper cleaning and disinfection of reusable patient care devices 
 However, these personnel will be restricted from performing the exposure-prone procedures as listed 
in Category I until counsel is received from an expert review panel. 
 The panel will take into consideration the procedure to be performed, the skill of the health-care 
provider, and any ruling of the health-care provider's licensing board. Also, decisions regarding 
participation in exposure-prone procedures may be based on the level of infectivity of the health-care 
provider as determined according to current medical guidelines. 
Acknowledgement: 
By signing below, I acknowledge that I have read and understand the above recommendations, if any, 
and the use of Standard Precautions. At all times during my clinical practice, current and future, at Our 
Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, I agree to follow the rules and decisions as set forth by the 
hospital’s Employee Health and Infection Prevention program.
