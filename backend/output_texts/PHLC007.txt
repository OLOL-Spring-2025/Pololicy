PURPOSE: 
Provide for the obtaining of blood samples from patients with special needs 
 
Addresses: 
Venipuncture Charge Techs  
Venipuncture Phlebotomists 
 
POLICY: 
Specimens acceptable for laboratory testing are to be collected 
• Check with the nurse before drawing if you notice the patient has external lines 
• Watch for signage posted above the patient’s head or on white board in patient’s room that describe 
precautions concerning the performance of phlebotomy 
• Watch for signage posted on the door to the patient’s room that describe precautions concerning the 
performance of phlebotomy 
• Check for special armbands located on the patient’s limbs such as “limb alert bands” that define or limit 
phlebotomy to the extremity the armband is placed on.   
• Specimens collected in less than ideal circumstances should have a comment documented in the Rover 
device and on the phlebotomist’s draw sheet detailing the circumstances concerning the collection 
• The comment should serve to alert the person performing the test of the conditions of collection 
 
A. Patients with Indwelling Lines, Locks, Vascular Access Devices: 
1. Patients with Arterial, Subclavian, or Hickman Catheters 
• These devices may be used to obtain specimens for laboratory testing 
• Sample collection from these devices is performed by nursing personnel 
• Lines must be cleared of contaminating fluids before collection of the sample for testing 
• Clearing of lines: 
o Withdraw and discard a volume blood equal to six times the volume of fluid contained 
by the indwelling line 
o Use a 5 to 10 cc discard if unable to determine to volume of indwelling line 
o A smaller volume of discard may be used in difficult patient situations, comment waste 
draw volume on the laboratory label 
2. Patients with Safe Line Sets 
• May be used to obtain specimens for laboratory testing 
• Sample collection is performed by nursing personnel 
• A 10-cc blood volume is pulled from the device with a syringe to clear the line 
• A second syringe is used to collect the blood sample for testing OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

• Vacutainer collection tubes may be substituted for the second syringe 
3. Patients with IV’s 
• IV placement is determined by nursing personnel 
• Only nursing personnel can turn off on IV 
• Phlebotomy or capillary collection site selection vary with patient condition and IV locations 
• Perform phlebotomy draws as follows: 
o On the arm opposite the IV when possible 
o Two to three inches below the IV site; best sample is obtained with the IV turned off for 
5 minutes before drawing 
o Above an IV only when other possible sites have been exhausted with the IV turned off 
for 5 minutes before drawing 
• If unable to turn off an IV, the patient with physician approval, may be drawn arterially by 
Respiratory Therapy personnel or from a vein in the foot by Venipuncture personnel 
4. Patient’s with Dialysis Shunts 
• Only nursing personnel can access a shunt 
• Phlebotomy or capillary sticks may not be performed on an arm having a dialysis shunt 
• Use the arm without the dialysis shunt for venipuncture or capillary draws 
• Inpatient’s should have a pink “Limb Alert” armband placed on the limb that is NOT to be 
utilized for blood collection  
5. Mastectomy Patients 
• Phlebotomy or capillary sticks may not be performed on the arm on the same side a mastectomy 
(breast removal) has been performed 
• Collect blood samples from the arm opposite the mastectomy side 
• Inpatient’s should have a pink “Limb Alert” armband placed on the limb that is NOT to be utilized 
for blood collection  
6. Chemotherapy Patients 
• Draw patients receiving chemotherapy from the arm opposite arm the one being used for drug 
administration 
• Chemotherapy patients cannot have phlebotomy in the forearm or antecubital space of the arm 
being used to administer anti-cancer drugs. 
• Drawing above the site of drug administration will cause the chemotherapy to be discontinued 
• With nursing permission, a draw site well below the chemotherapy IV site could be used 
7. TPA Patients 
• Patients receiving this clot dissolving drug are at risk of extended bleeding 
• Check with the patient’s nurse before drawing, the patient may have an access line 
• Hold pressure on the phlebotomy site for 20 minutes 
• Continue to hold pressure for 20 minutes even if the phlebotomy site appears not to be bleeding 
 
B. Patients Receiving Transfusion: 
1. In general, most laboratory test will be drawn even if patient is receiving a blood transfusion and the 
words “Patient receiving blood transfusion” written on the laboratory label.  No consultation with the 
nurse is generally necessary. 
 
2. However, orders of CBC, Hgb, HCT, should be treated differently.  DO NOT DRAW, these tests on a 
patient receiving a blood transfusion UNLESS specifically ordered to do so by a nurse or physician.  If 
specimen is not drawn, write on the request form “Patient receiving blood transfusion” and notify the 
patient’s nurse.

3. If the nurse of physician wants the blood specimen drawn after the unit of blood has been administered, 
ask the nurse to notify the Laboratory when the transfusion has been completed.  The phlebotomist should 
then write on the request form the words, “Hold- Nurse_ (NURSE) _ will call; Patient receiving blood”. 
 
C. STAT and TIMED Collection Requests: 
1. STAT Laboratory Orders: Highest priority. Used to identify “potential life-threatening results” 
• Collect immediately 
• Directly after collection, walk specimens down to laboratory before drawing another patient 
• Collection delays (including unable to obtain collections) must be documented in the Rover 
device, reported to the patient’s nurse, and reported to the Venipuncture charge tech immediately 
2. TIMED Laboratory Orders: 
• Collect at the time requested.   
• A 15-minute grace period before or after the scheduled time is allotted for multiple patient 
requests for Timed collections. 
• Directly after collection, walk/send specimens down to laboratory before drawing another patient 
• Collection delays (including unable to obtain collections) must be documented, reported to the 
patient’s nurse, and reported to the Venipuncture charge tech immediately 
 
D. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring: 
1. Therapeutic drug monitoring refers to drug levels done on patients at specified intervals.  Therapeutic 
drugs are maintained at optimal serum concentrations to provide maximum benefit to the patient.  
Drawing the drug levels at the requested time is necessary to provide the physician information to 
determine adequate dosing requirements of the patient. 
2. Drug Levels 
• Peak Levels 
o Refer to the maximum obtainable drug concentrations 
o Drawn at specified time following the drug administration 
• Trough Levels 
o Refer to the lowest level of drug concentration in the patient 
o Drawn just before the next dose of the drug 
• Collection Priority: 
o Orders as Timed Collections 
o Drawn at the time requested 
o A 15-minute grace period before or after the scheduled time is allotted for multiple 
patient requests for timed collections. 
o Timed Drug Level have priority over other Timed lab orders take 
• Specific Drug Level Collection Requirements 
o Refer to the Chemistry Department or Pharmacy Department regarding additional 
information for Trough and Peak collections per specified drug. 
 
E. Patient Reactions: 
1. Fainting (Syncope) or Unexpected Non- responsiveness  
• If the patient is sitting, lower head and arms; if the patient is lying down, elevate feet 
• Loosen tight clothing that may interfere with breathing 
• Notify the nursing station of the patient difficulty 
• Stay with the patient until nursing personnel respond OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

• For an outpatient, notify Supervisor or Lab Charge Tech who can activate an Emergency 
Code (x5-3333, MET Team) if needed due to non-responsiveness, or if patient becomes 
responsive, Supervisor/Charge Tech can contact the Emergency Room for further 
instruction. 
2. Convulsions/Seizures 
• Prevent the patient from injuring himself/herself. Do not restrain the movements of the 
patient completely, but try to prevent him /her from being injured 
• Notify the nursing station of the patient difficulty 
• Stay with the patient until nursing personnel respond 
• For an outpatient, notify Supervisor or Lab Charge Tech who can activate an Emergency 
Code (x5-3333, MET Team) if needed due to non-responsiveness, or if patient becomes 
responsive Supervisor/Charge Tech can contact the Emergency Room for further 
instruction. 
3. Nausea 
• Position the patient comfortably with his or her head lowered 
• Instruct the patient to breathe deeply and slowly 
• Notify the nursing station of the patient difficulty 
• Stay with the patient until nursing personnel respond 
4. Vomiting 
• Roll prone patients onto their side 
• Give patient a basin or other container, if available 
• Notify the nursing station of the patient difficulty 
• Stay with the patient until nursing personnel respond 
5. Excessive Bleeding/Hematomas 
• Apply and hold direct pressure to the venipuncture site 
• Continue until bleeding stops 
• Notify the patients nurse of the difficulty 
• Notify the Venipuncture Charge Tech or Supervisor of the difficulty 
6. Nerve Injury 
• If the patient feels a shooting, electric-like pain, or tingling or numbness proximal or 
distal to the venipuncture site: 
o Terminate the venipuncture and remove the needle immediately 
o Repeat the venipuncture in another site with a new sterile needle if needed. 
o Needle is to be placed superficially, use short needles such as butterfly or 
perform capillary draw if applicable to test. 
o Notify the patients nurse 
o Notify the Venipuncture Tech or Supervisor of the difficulty  
7.  Abrasions 
• Can occur with a scratch from a needle or tourniquet placement 
o Scratches may be superficial or deep 
o Tourniquets can rub off a layer(s) of the skin 
o Minimal bleeding may be involved 
o If bleeding occurs, apply and hold direct pressure to the site 
o Continue until bleeding stops OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

Limitations of Procedure 
1. Check the door to the patient’s room, the wall directly above the head of the patient, or the white board 
in the patient’s room for signage, or special armbands such as “limb alert bands” that define or limit 
phlebotomy 
2. Follow posted instructions 
3. If no signage, posted instruction, and/or armband exists for concerning phlebotomy draw instructions, but the 
patient notifies you of the collection concern, please contact the patient’s nurse immediately for clarification 
including adding the necessary signage or armband to prevent any potential collection concerns during the 
patient’s stay. 
3.  Describe collection processes that may affect the quality of the sample 
• Sample drawn above IV, IV turned off for 2 minutes 
• Unit collect, 10 cc discard 
• Drawn below IV, IV running 
• Fingerstick below IV, IV running 
4. Documentation in Rover device and on phlebotomist’s draw sheet 
5. Blood collections attempts involving unexpected patient reactions may also require the submission of a safety 
event report.
