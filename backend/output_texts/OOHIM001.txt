receive copies of his/her medical records while still a patient in the hospital. 
 
POLICY: 
It is the policy of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center that all requests for information 
concerning hospital patients must be transferred to the Medical Records Department.  The request for 
information must follow standard release of information policy and procedures.  Authorization from a

from the patient.   
 
2. Attending physician will be contacted to complete a release of information approval/denial form.    
 
A. It is the policy of the Our Lady of the Lake RMC to secure written permission from a 
licensed healthcare professional prior to release of information of hospital patients. The 
“Request for Release of Information Request form-MD-Inhouse patient” shall be utilized 
to secure permission.  (See attachment)   
 
B. A health care provider may deny access to a record if the health care provider reasonably 
concludes that knowledge of the information contained in the record would be injurious 
to the health or welfare of the patient or could reasonable be expected to endanger the life 
of safety of any other person (LA. R.S. 1299.96) 
 
C. A written authorization from the patient requesting the medical record shall be obtained.   
 
D.   Approval or Denials of Access 
1. All denials of access, in whole or in part, will be referred to the Privacy Officer. 
2.  Some requests for PHI are considered Non-Reviewable Denials 
 
A denial of access will be issued and will not be reviewable if:

anticipation of litigation or administrative proceeding; or (iii) laboratory information subject to or exempted from the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 
1988. 
b.  Our Lady of the Lake RMC is acting under the direction of a correctional 
institution and the information could jeopardize the health, safety, security, custody or 
rehabilitation of the individual, any officer, employee, or other inmates, or of any 
officer, employee, or other person at the correctional institution or responsible for the 
transporting of the inmate. 
c. The PHI was created or obtained in the course of research that includes treatment.  
(In such cases access may be temporarily suspended for as long as the research is in 
progress, provided that the individual has agreed to the denial of access when 
consenting to participate in the research, and has been informed that the right of 
access will be reinstated upon the completion of the research.) 
d. The PHI is contained in records that are subject to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 
552a.  (Access to such records may be denied under certain circumstances governed 
by that law.) 
e. The PHI was obtained from someone other than a health care provider under a 
promise of confidentiality and the access requested would be reasonably lively to 
reveal the source of the information. 
 
3. All other requests from patients to review or obtain records will be submitted to the 
licensed healthcare professional using the “Request for Release of Information 
Request form”. 
 
4.  The licensed healthcare professional may: 
 a. Grant permission to release information to the patient, or 
 
1.  Once “Release of Information Request Form” noting approval from 
licensed healthcare professional is received, Medical records personnel 
will remain with the patient while reviewing his/her record.  Medical 
Records personnel will not give any interpretation of the medical record.  
The patient will be referred to the attending physician for clarification. 
2.  If requested, copies of medical records will be provided within an eight 
hour timeframe.  The patient will be charged for copies.

exercise of professional judgment, that the requested access is reasonably 
likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the individual or another 
person;

health care provider) and a licensed healthcare professional has 
determined, in the exercise of professional judgment, that the requested 
access is reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to that other person; 
or  
 c. The request for access is made by the individual’s personal 
representative and a licensed healthcare professional has determined, in 
the exercise of professional judgment, that the provision of access to such 
personal representative is reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to 
the individual or another person.   
 
2.   In denying access in whole or in part to the extent possible, staff 
assigned to release of information for hospital records will give the 
individual access to any other protected health information requested, after 
excluding the PHI that was denied.

Release of Information Request form-MD-Inhouse patient” and the 
Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information shall be sent to

person or office designated to receive such complaints.

the individual’s request for access but knows where the requested information is 
maintained, Our Lady of the Lake RMC must inform the individual where to 
direct the request for access.   
 
6.  The patient may request in writing a review of a denied request for access.
