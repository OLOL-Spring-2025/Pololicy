1. Overview and Scope 
1.1. This policy provides an overview of FMOLHS Baton Rouge Market Pharmacies’ Sterile 
Compounding Program which operates pursuant to the current version of USP <797>, related 
USP chapters, relevant Federal regulatory guidelines (e.g., FDA guidance), and in accordance with 
the Louisiana State statutes governing sterile compounding practices. The Sterile Compounding 
Program outlines the following: 
• Type of healthcare organization or practice(s) engaged in sterile compounding 
• Type and location of compounding area(s) and ISO Class 5 hoods used 
• Categories of CSP compounded 
• Personnel performing sterile compounding 
• General types of sterile preparations compounded 
• Patient populations served  
1.2. The overriding goal of the Sterile Compounding Program is to minimize harm, including death, to 
patients that could result from:  
• Microbial contamination [nonsterility] 
• Excessive bacterial endotoxins 
• Variability from the intended strength of correct ingredients 
• Physical and chemical incompatibilities 
• Chemical and physical contaminants, and/or  
• Use of ingredients of inappropriate quality 
1.3. Sterile compounding is defined as combining, admixing, diluting, pooling, reconstituting, 
repackaging, or otherwise altering a drug or bulk drug substance to create a sterile medication. 
While not an exhaustive list, the following CSPs are considered sterile preparations:  
• Injections 
• Intravenous infusions  
• Irrigations for internal body cavities (i.e., any space that does not normally communicate with 
the environment outside of the body, such as the bladder cavity or peritoneal cavity). [Note— 
Irrigations for the mouth, rectal cavity, and sinus cavity are not required to be sterile.]  
• Ophthalmic dosage forms  
• Aqueous preparations for pulmonary inhalation. [Note —Nasal dosage forms intended for 
local application are not required to be sterile.]  
• Baths and soaks for live organs and tissues  • Implants  
1.3. USP <797> defines CSP risk levels or categories of compounding that are primarily based on the 
state of environmental control under which the CSP is compounded, the probability for microbial 
growth during the time the CSP is stored, and the time period within which the CSP is to be used.  
USP <797> redefined CSP into the following categories:   
• Immediate Use CSPs  – compounded in less than ISO Class 5 conditions (e.g. bedside or 
countertop), with 3 or fewer sterile products, and a maximum BUD of 4 hours after the 
initiation of compounding. 
• Category 1 CSPs – compounded in ISO Class 5 PEC located in a segregated compounding area 
with a maximum BUD of 12 hours when stored at room temperature or 24 hours when 
refrigerated. 
• Category 2 CSPs  – compounded in an ISO Class 5 PEC located within a classified sterile 
compounding facility and adhering to USP BUDs based on storage conditions, administration 
of CSP sterility testing, sterilization method, and sterility of starting components. 
• Category 3 CSPs – compounded in an ISO classified sterile compounding facility with increased 
garbing, environmental monitoring, compounding oversight requirements, and CSP sterility 
and endotoxin testing requirements allowing for extended BUD assignments. 
1.4. Administration of medication, preparation of allergenic extract prescription sets, blood -derived 
and other biological material processing that occurs physically removed from sterile 
compounding activities, and sterile radiopharmaceuticals is not in the sco pe of the Sterile 
Compounding Program and USP <797>.

successfully complete and remain current in all Sterile Compounding Core Competencies.  These 
personnel include:

Designated Person(s) or designee and expected to comply with all aspects of the Sterile

3. Roles & Responsibilities 
3.1 The Designated Person(s) (DP): The DP is responsible for the Sterile Compounding Program and 
is accountable for the performance and operation of the sterile compounding facility and 
equipment; environmental monitoring and maintaining a state of microbial c ontrol within 
controlled areas; personnel competency qualification; and ongoing compliance with the 
Standard Operating Procedures. 
4.  Procedures 
4.1  The  Sterile Compounding Program is guided by policies and standard operating procedures, 
which are further outlined in this policy manual.  
4.2. All Sterile Compounding Program policies and procedures are reviewed every 12 months, at a 
minimum, by the Designated Person and relevant committees.   
4.3  Any changes to Sterile Compounding Program policies and procedures are approved by the 
Designated Person and communicated to personnel in a manner commensurate with the 
degree of change.  
 
5. Definitions 
 
5.1 Biological safety cabinet (BSC) : A ventilated cabinet with an open front and inward and downward 
unidirectional HEPA-filtered airflow and HEPA -filtered exhaust. A BSC used to prepare a CSP must be 
capable of providing an ISO Class 5 or better environment for preparation of the CSPs. 
5.2 Classified area: An area that maintains an air quality classification based on the ISO standards (see 
also the definition for ISO class).5.3 Compounded sterile preparation (CSP): A preparation intended to be 
sterile that is created by combining, admixing, diluting, pooling, reconstituting, repackaging, or otherwise 
altering a drug product or bulk drug substance 5.4Compounding area: The area where compounding is occurring (i.e., a cleanroom suite, inside the 
perimeter of the SCA, or AECA). 
5.5 Compounding aseptic containment isolator (CACI): A type of RABS that uses HEPA filtration to provide 
an ISO Class 5 unidirectional air environment designed for the compounding of sterile HDs.  
5.6 Compounding aseptic isolator (CAI): A type of RABS that uses HEPA filtration to provide an ISO Class 
5 unidirectional air environment designed for compounding of sterile non-HDs. 
5.7 Containment ventilated enclosure (CVE): A full or partial enclosure that uses ventilation principles to 
capture, contain, and remove airborne contaminants through HEPA filtration and prevent their release 
into the work environment. 
5.8 Immediate-use CSP: CSP aseptically compounded outside of ISO classified air for direct and immediate 
administration to a single patient with a maximum BUD of 4 hours after the initiation of compounding. 
5.9 Integrated vertical laminar flow zone (IVLFZ): A designated ISO Class 5 area serving as the PEC within 
an ISO Class 7 or cleaner buffer room. In the IVLFZ, unidirectional airflow is created by placing HEPA filters 
over the entire surface of the worktables and by effective placement of air returns. 
5.10 Laminar airflow workbench (LAFW): A device that is a type of LAFS that provides an ISO Class 5 or 
better air quality environment for sterile compounding. The device provides a unidirectional HEPA-filtered 
airflow. 
5.11 Pharmaceutical isolator: An enclosure that provides HEPA -filtered ISO Class 5 unidirectional air 
operated at a continuously higher pressure than its surrounding environment and is decontaminated 
using an automated system. It uses only decontaminated interfaces or rapid transfer p orts for materials 
transfer.  
5.12 Primary engineering control (PEC): A device or zone that provides an ISO Class 5 air quality 
environment for sterile compounding. 
5.13 Secondary engineering control (SEC): The area where the PEC is placed (e.g., a cleanroom suite or 
an SCA). It incorporates specific design and operational parameters required to minimize the risk of 
contamination within the compounding area.  
5.14 Segregated compounding area (SCA): A designated, unclassified space, area, or room with a defined 
perimeter that contains a PEC and is suitable for preparation of Category 1 CSPs only.
