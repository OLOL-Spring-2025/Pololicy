     member, licensed independent practitioner, visitor, or vendor while on site at 
     the organization/facility or while providing care/supervision to patients 
□ Surgery or other invasive procedure performed at the wrong site, on the  
      wrong patient, or that is the wrong (unintended) procedure for a patient 
      regardless of the type of procedure or the magnitude of the outcome  
□ Discharge of an infant to the wrong family 
□ Abduction of any patient receiving care, treatment, and services 
□ Any elopement (that is, unauthorized departure) of a patient from a staffed  
       around-the-clock care setting (including the ED), leading to death, permanent 
      harm, or severe harm to the patient  
 
□ Administration of blood or blood products having 
unintended ABO and non-ABO incompatibilities, hemolytic 
transfusion reactions, or transfusions resulting in severe 
harm, permanent harm, or death                                                        
□ Unintended retention of a foreign object in a patient after 
an invasive procedure, including surgery§ 
□ Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin >30 
       milligrams/deciliter) 
□ Fluoroscopy resulting in permanent tissue injury when  
       clinical and technical optimization were not implemented 
       and/or recognized practice parameters were not followed 
□ Any delivery of radiotherapy to the wrong patient, wrong  
       body region, unintended procedure, or >25% above the  
       planned radiotherapy dose 
□ Fire, flame, or unanticipated smoke, heat, or flashes  
       occurring during direct patient care caused by equipment  
       operated and used by the organization. To be considered  
       a sentinel event, equipment must be in use at the time of  
       the event; staff do not need to be present.  
□ Fall in a staffed-around-the-clock care setting or fall in a  
      care setting not staffed around the clock during a time  
       when staff are present resulting in any of the following:    
o Any fracture, o Surgery, casting, or traction, o Required   
consult/management or comfort care for a neurological or 
internal injury, o A patient with coagulopathy who receives 
blood products as a result of the fall, o Death or permanent 
harm as a result of injuries sustained from the fall (not from 
physiologic events causing the fall)

Sentinel Event Supplement and Notes 
permanent harm An event or condition that reaches the individual, resulting in any level of harm that permanently alters and/or affects 
an individual’s baseline health. 
 
severe harm An event or condition that reaches the individual, resulting in life-threatening bodily injury (including pain or 
disfigurement) that interferes with or results in loss of functional ability or quality of life that requires continuous phys iological 
monitoring and/or surgery, invasive procedure, or treatment to resolve the condition.  
 
sexual abuse/assault Nonconsensual sexual contact of any type with an individual. Sexual abuse includes, but is not limited to, the 
following:  
• Unwanted intimate touching of any kind, especially of the breasts, buttocks, or perineal area  
• All types of sexual assault or battery, such as rape, sodomy, and coerced nudity (partial or complete)  
• Forced observation of masturbation and/or sexually explicit images, including pornography, texts, or social media  
• Taking sexually explicit photographs and/or audio/video recordings of an individual and maintaining and/or distributing them 
(for example, posting on social media); this would include, but is not limited to, nudity, fondling, and/or intercourse invol ving 
an individual  
 
Generally, sexual contact is nonconsensual in the following situations:  
• When the individual lacks the cognitive or legal ability to consent even though appearing to want the contact to occur  
• When the individual does not want the contact to occur  
 
Other examples of nonconsensual sexual contact may include but are not limited to situations where an individual is sedated, is 
temporarily unconscious, or is in a coma. An individual’s apparent consent to engage in sexual activity is not valid if it is  obtained from 
the individual lacking the capacity to consent, or consent is obtained through intimidation, coercion, or fear, whether it is  expressed by 
the individual or suspected by staff. Any forced, coerced, or extorted sexual relationship, is considered  to be sexual abuse. 
 
Organizations are required to conduct an investigation and protect an individual(s) from nonconsensual sexual relations anyti me the 
organization has reason to suspect that the individual(s) does not wish to engage in sexual activity or may not have the cog nitive or legal 
ability to consent. 
 
invasive procedure A procedure in which skin or mucous membranes and/or connective tissue are incised or punctured, an instrument 
is introduced through a natural body orifice, or foreign material is inserted into the body for diagnostic or treatment -related purposes. 
Examples of invasive procedures include central line and chest tube insertions, biopsies and excisions, and all percutaneous proced ures 
(for example, cardiac, electrophysiology, interventional radiology). Exclusions include venipuncture, which is defined as a c ollection of 
blood from a vein. Note: This exclusion is still considered a patient safety event and should be reviewed by the appropriate local quality 
and safety teams. 
 
The time- period after a surgery or invasive procedure encompasses any time after the completion of final skin closure, even if the 
patient is still in the procedural area or in the operating room under anesthesia. A failure to identify and correct an unint ended 
retention of a foreign object prior to that point in the procedure represents a system failure, which requires analysis and redesign. It 
also places the patient at additional risk by extending the surgical procedure and time under anesthesia. If a f oreign object (for example, 
a needle tip or screw) is left in the patient because of a clinical determination that the relative risk to the patient of se arching for and 
removing the object exceeds the benefit of removal, this would not be considered a revi ewable sentinel event. However, in such cases, 
the organization shall (1) disclose to the patient the unintended retention and (2) keep a record of the retentions to identi fy trends and 
patterns (for example, by type of procedure, by type of retained item, by manufacturer, by practitioner) that may identify opportunities 
for improvement.

severe maternal morbidity A patient safety event that occurs from the intrapartum through the immediate postpartum period (24 
hours), requiring the transfusion of 4 or more units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and/or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
Admission to the ICU is defined as admission to a unit that provides 24- hour medical supervision and can provide mechanical ventilation 
or continuous vasoactive drug support. Sources: American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the US Centers f or Disease Control and 
Prevention, and the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine.
