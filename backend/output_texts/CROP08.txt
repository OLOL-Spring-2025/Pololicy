Procedure: 
 
Assessment of patient/ family education needs begins during the patient orientation and continues throughout 
the course of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation. During the orientation process, patient goals and risk factor 
modification are introduced to patient and family using the Treatment Plan Summary.    
 
The patient/family educational needs are evaluated on an ongoing basis by all staff members, with formal 
evaluation at 12, 24, and 36 sessions, using the patient Conference Questionnaire. As a patient indicates a 
particular educational need or has difficulty answering one of the questions concerning risk factors or goal 
accomplishment, the following responses may occur to fulfill the patient or familyâ€™s needs: 
 
  1. The patient/family will be counseled according to those demonstrated needs by one of the     
     Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation staff.  
 2. It will be suggested to the patient/family to attend the educational class pertaining to that particular 
     need (to attend initially or as review, if previously attended). 
 3. The patient/family may be given written educational material pertaining to the risk factor or the  
     education class if that education class cannot be attended for some reason. 
 4. The patient/family may be encouraged to borrow video educational material which deals with their 
     needs or concerns. 
 5. The patient/family may be referred to other appropriate services at their request or with their      
     approval for demonstrated needs.
