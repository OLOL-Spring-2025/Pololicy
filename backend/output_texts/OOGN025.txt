PURPOSE: 
The purpose of the Patient Safety and Quality Organizational Performance Improvement Plan is to 
ensure the Governing Board of Directors, Me dical Staff, and hospital staff  demonstrate a consistent 
effort to improve the delivery of care to patients through a systematic, coordinated, priority -driven 
approach to performance improvement  and Everyday Excellence .  The program aligns with the 
Organizational Mission, Vision and Core Values and provides an infrastructure designed to deliver 
quality health care, promote patient safety, monitor and measure key functions and processes, and 
identify opportunities based on data analysis. 
 
SCOPE: 
This document represents the Our Lady of the Lake Health (OLOL) Organizational PI Plan for the 
Patient Safety and Quality Program as approved by the Governing Board of Directors. The components 
of the Patient Safety and Quality Performance Improvement Plan include, but are not limited to: 
 
• Quality improvement and patient safety oversight, assistance, and coordination relative to patient 
care services and operations 
• Quality improvement and patient safety functions requiring assessment, improvement, 
monitoring, aggregation and analysis 
• Facilitation and project management support of performance improvement teams 
• Benchmarking, best practice identification, and data comparison support 
• Data management, data aggregation, monitoring, and analysis of key strategic initiatives, sentinel 
event/critical incident risk reduction strategies, Joint Commission required measures, National 
Patient Safety Goals and other analysis as deemed appropriate  
• Thorough and credible assessment of sentinel events and/or other critical incidents 
 
POLICY:  
OLOL will improve processes in a collaborative effort to yield better than expected , reliable outcomes. 
OLOL will select, measure, aggregate, and monitor performance indicators to ensure success and 
identify opportunities for excellence. OLOL is committed to the ongoing improvement of the quality of 
care its patients receive, as evidenced by the outcomes of that care. The organization continuously 
strives to ensure: 
• The culture of the organization supports safety, transparency,  high-reliability, and performance 
excellence. 
• The care, treatment, procedures, and services  provided incorporate evidence based, effective 
practices. 
   OrgOps/GN/025 2 
• The care, treatment, procedures and services provided are appropriate to each patient’s needs, 
and are performed in a safe, timely and efficient manner, with appropriate coordination and 
continuity across all phases of care and all providers of care. 
• Risk to patients, providers and others is minimized, and errors in the delivery of services are 
prevented. 
• Patient’s individual needs and expectations are respected; patients – or those whom they 
designate – have the opportunity to participate in decisions regarding their treatment and services 
are provided with sensitivity and caring. 
Value to patients, providers and team members is reinforced through leadership ’s commitment to 
reducing clinical variati on, eliminating harm, the establishment of a quality curriculum, a focus on 
safety, and the utilization of robust process improvement tools (Fig 1.1).  Using a patient centered 
approach to quality and patient safety, iterative improvements are made by applying an interdisciplinary, 
evidenced based practice approach.

Continuous Quality Improvement Principles   
 
LakeLean.  LakeLean is OLOL Health’s approach to continuous quality improvement principles that 
reduce waste and achieve better efficiency  tosupport a safe environment for patients, their families, and 
team members . LakeLean is designed to continuously improve performance by identifying and 
eliminating wastes. All team members, physicians and leaders are asked to support LakeLean practices 
in their everyday work to help improve processes and the patient experience. Additionally, OLOL 
Health has adopted the following quality and patient safety principles from the Baldrige Framework:  
 
• Leadership Involvement.  Strong leadership, direction and support of quality improvement and 
patient safety activities by the governing body and Executive Leadership Team  are key to a 
culture of performance improvement and patient safety.  This involvement of organizational 
senior leadership assures that quality improvement and patient safety initiatives are consistent 
with the  vision, the  mission, the core values  and the strategic plan . Their involvement also 
ensures organization-wide systems for safety and quality are supported.  
• Evidence-Based Decision Making .  Successful performance improvement processes create 
feedback loops, using data to improve practice, measure results, and identify opportunities for   OrgOps/GN/025 3 
Core Framework of Patient Safety 
excellence.  
• Statistical Tools . For continuous improvement, tools and methods are needed that foster 
knowledge and understanding. Organizations with a culture of performance excellence use a 
defined set of analytic tools such as run charts, cause and effect diagrams, flowcharts, Pareto 
charts, histograms, and control charts to turn data into information. 
• Systems Thinking. For continuous improvement of organizational performance, efforts are made 
to identify and eliminate waste across the patient continuum, therefore decreasing the risk of 
breakdowns and system failures. 
Quality Improvement Activities 
To ensure strategic alignment, quality improvement activities emerge from a systematic and organized 
framework for  patient safety . (Figure 1.1 -1) This quality improvement framework incorporates the 
following key elements: 
 
• Patient-centered approach (Quality Goals) 
• Multidisciplinary (Interdisciplinary Quality) 
• Team-based care (All Persons Input Valued) 
• Efficient (Cost to Patient) and Outcome Focused 
• Common Medical Informatics (Optimal Clinical Database and Health Information Exchange) 
• Recognition of Geographic Factors (REL & SDOH) 
• Reduction in Evidence Based Medicine Translation time

Section 1: Leadership, Organization and Work Environment  
 
Leadership The key to the success of the Quality & Patient Safety Program  is effective leadership 
participation and commitment.  The Quality & Patient Safety Program, under the governance of the 
Performance Excellence  Subcommittee of the Board of Directors , bases decisions on the following 
Deming-based principles:   OrgOps/GN/025 4 
• A commitment to championing performance improvement efforts. 
• A commitment to be a change agent in transforming the culture from reactive to proactive.  
• A commitment to challenging processes and identifying opportunities for improvement.  
• A commitment to maintaining organizational focus on identified quality goals. 
• A commitment to fostering teamwork. 
• A commitment to providing the resources necessary to reach goals. 
• A commitment to analyzing data based on trends and patterns as opposed to a single data point. 
• A commitment to actively participate in performance improvement education activities.  
• A commitment to fostering, recognizing and rewarding a culture of safety and quality. 
 
Organization. A list of the committees and workgroups key to the success of the Patient Safety and 
Performance Improvement program and their roles and responsibilities are displayed in Figure 1.1 -3. 
Figure 1.1-4 displays the Performance Improvement Information Flow.   
 
Work Environment.  Every team member is responsible for ensuring that not only themselves, but 
other team members, abide by the Mission, Core Values, Service Standards and Principles of 
Organizational Ethics.  
 
Our Lady of the Lake Health recognizes the value of a positive work environment. Our Lady of the Lake 
Health Policy OrgOps/GN/034 Principles and Standards for Team Member Behavior was 
developed to clearly delineate those behaviors that are acceptable and positively impact quality and 
safety transformation from  inappropriate, disruptive and intolerable behaviors.

Section 3: Performance Measurement  
 
Performance Measurement is the process of regularly assessing the results produced by the program.  
It involves identifying processes, systems and outcomes that are integral to the performance of the 
service delivery system, selecting indicators of these processes, systems and outcomes, and analyzing 
information related to these indicators on a regular basis.   
 
Selection of a  Key Performance Indicator.   A performance indicator is a quantitative tool that 
provides information about the performance of the hospital’s process, services, functions or outcomes.  
Selection of a Performance Indicator is based on the following considerations:  
• Relevance to mission - whether the indicator addresses the population served  
• Relevance to the Strategic Plan - whether the indicator addresses and supports our strategic plan  
• Organizational importance  - whether it addresses important processes that are  high volume , 
problem prone or high risk

Section 4: LakeLean  Management Team 
The LakeLean Management team acts as the evaluation committee , the performance improvement 
subject matter experts and make decisions regarding  team commission ing and decommissioning  of 
performance improvement teams . Figure 4.1 identifies the P erformance Improvement (P I) Funnel 
Management for identifying, prioritizing, executing and tracking projects.  The LakeLean Structure and 
Sustainability Playbook is an ongoing and living reference to ensure thoroughness and consistency of 
approach in performance improvement. The Playbook outlines the principles, tools, systems and 
structures that enable leaders to successfully implement organizational improvements.

Lakelean Improvement Funnel 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commissioning: A performance improvement team can be recommended via multiple data sources that 
includes but is not limited to: 
• Team member suggestions 
• Department / Workgroup / Service Lines 
•  
• Franciscan Health Physicians 
• Board / Leadership Imperative 
• Publicly Reported Data (e.g., Leapfrog, US News, CMS/TJC) 
• External / Customer / Community 
 
Although LakeLean (DMAIS) is the primary model used by OLOL  Health, other met hodologies are 
deployed based on the size and scope of the improvement initiative  (e.g., Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), 
six sigma).  
  
OLOL Health employs project management principles to manage the PI team process. A LakeLean 
Dashboard track s project goal metrics. Clinical quality improvement initiatives are tracked via the  
STEEP (Safe, Timely, Effective, Efficient, Equitable, Patient -Centered) Quality Dashboard which is 
reviewed quarterly with the Performance Excellence Committee & MEC.  Use of LakeLean resources 
for PI Teams will consider the following: 
• Multi-departmental/Cross-functional Teams  
• Project Prioritization 
  
Once commissioned, team progress will be evaluated by the Quality Leadership Team  to ensure that 
Yes 
No   OrgOps/GN/025 11 
progress is being made and the applicable dimensions of performance are being addressed. The  process 
owner will be responsible for reporting the following: 
• Team status barriers 
• Successes 
• Measurement results 
• Organizational learning from cycles of improvement 
Decommissioning: 
Prior to decommissioning, project teams will present their outcome to the appropriate quality committee 
to ensure sustainable results. 
Section 5: Sentinel Events, Adverse Events and Near Misses:  
OLOL Health identifies and responds to sentinel events occurring in its facilities as detailed in Policy 
OrgOps/GN/018 Sentinel Events and Root Cause Analysis.  Adverse events and near misses are 
evaluated as outlined in OrgOps/GN/019 Safety Event (Incident or Variance) Reporting. Disclosures 
are performed as outlined in Org/Clinical 007: Disclosure of Unanticipated Outcomes, Medical 
Errors, and Sentinel Events. 
Peer Review 
The peer review process addresses the specific care or aberrant patterns of care rendered by an 
individual medical staff member.  Reviews are performed through the Professional Practice Evaluation 
Committee (PPEC) (Policy MSPHY019 Professional Practice Evaluation)  
Section 6: Quality & Patient Safety Program Evaluation and Organizational Learning 
At least once a year the following will be presented to the  Performance Excellence Committee of the 
Board of Directors:  
• Systems or process failures 
• The number and type of sentinel events, including disclosure to patient and/or family 
• Actions taken to improve safety, both proactively and in response to actual occurrences 
• Progress towards meeting the Annual Goals/Objectives of OLOL Health’ss Patient Safety and 
Quality Organizational PI Plan. 
Section 7: Patient Safety Evaluation System (PSES) and Patient Safety Work Product (PSWP) 
OLOL designates this Quality & Patient Safety Performance Improvement  Plan as part of its PSES and the 
activities, data, reports, etc derived from this PI Plan as PSWP (Policy FMOLHS PSO). All patient safety and 
quality improvement activities described in the PSES are conducted with the intent to transfer the PSWP to a 
Patient Safety Organization (PSO)  protection.  Recommendations for best practices and workflow processes 
related to the PSWP will be disseminated to minimize patient risk and improve the quality of care.
