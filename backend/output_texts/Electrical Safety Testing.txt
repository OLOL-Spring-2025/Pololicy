1.PURPOSE -- SCOPE
Recognizing that the term "Electrical Safety" refers to a process within the healthcare 
environment, and not merely a specific procedure, TRIMEDX will collaborate with our 
customers to help provide an electrically safe environment. One such action in support of 
the process of Electrical Safety is to complete specific types of testing on electrically 
powered medical equipment. Electrical safety testing of clinical electrical/electronic 
devices is the responsibility of TRIMEDX, in accordance with the terms of our specific 
customer agreements to prevent harm to patients and staff.
Leakage current and ground resistance values will be measured during the incoming 
inspection and/or maintenance procedures for each device when electrical safety testing 
is a required component of the inspection(s). Values (outputs) must be recorded on the 
work order and the indication of pass or fail within limits stated in the criteria section of 
each testing procedure. 
Devices that are not in the scope are battery powered (under 20 or 12 volts) devices and 
two-pronged devices where visual inspection of cord is acceptable to ensure it is double 
insulated and intact.

6.PROCEDURE
6.1.Perform electrical safety testing on electrically powered medical devices during 
incoming inventory on new equipment prior to initial clinical use and following 
repairs and modifications.
6.2.NFPA 99, 2012 Testing requirements for electrical equipment within healthcare 
facilities:
6.2.1. Physical Integrity of the power cord by visual inspection
6.2.2. Resistance between the appliance chassis and ground pin of the attachment 
plug must be less than 0.50 ohm.
6.3.Leakage Current Tests:
For Fixed Equipment: tested prior to installation while equipment is temporarily 
insulated from ground; the leakage current flowing through the ground conductor 
of the power supply to ground of the permanently wired devices shall not exceed 
10.0 mA (ac or dc) with all grounds lifted
6.3.1.For Touch Current - Portable Equipment: touch current for cord-connected 
equipment shall not exceed 100 microamperes with ground wire intact with 
normal polarity; shall not exceed 500 microamperes with ground wire 
disconnected
6.3.1.1.Lead Leakage Current Tests: 
6.3.1.1.1.For Portable Equipment: leakage current between all patient 
leads connected together shall be measured with power plug 
connected normally and device on; leakage current shall not 
exceed 100 microamperes for ground wire closed and 500 
microamperes for ground wire open
6.3.1.1.2.Use Attachment 1: Summary of Limits for Portable Equipment 
as a reference.
