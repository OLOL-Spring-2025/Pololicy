PURPOSE: To define the process for receipt, storage, dispensing, recall and disposal of formula samples. 
 
POLICY:  All staff involved in the receipt, storage, dispensing, recall and disposal of formula samples will 
adhere to the following: 
 
1. Formula samples, as requested by an OLOLCH Provider, may be brought to the clinic by a product 
representative and may be dispensed to patients of OLOL Children’s Hospital as ordered by the patients’ 
provider. 
2. Sample formula is not to be utilized by team members for their own or their family’s use. 
3. The formula will be stored according to manufacture recommendations and will be monitored monthly 
for expiration and recorded on the appropriate log. 
4. A formula sample tracking log will be maintained in the area in which the formula is stored to document 
information for tracking and recall purposes (see attachment). 
5. Recalls of formula samples will be handled in the following manner: 
a. Upon receipt of a recall notice, a Clinical Nutrition team member will immediately ensure that 
all recalled sample products are removed from stock and will notify the product representative to 
pick up the affected samples. 
b. The Tracking Log for Samples will be reviewed to identify patients who received recalled 
samples and the ordering Provider will be notified about the recall to address any substitutions 
he/she feels appropriate.  The patient will be notified by a Clinical Nutrition team member and 
advised to discontinue the recalled sample and follow any recommendations given by their 
Provider. 
c. All actions will be documented in the patient’s medical record and on the Recall Log for Sample 
Formulas (see attachment).
