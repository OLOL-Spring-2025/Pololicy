PURPOSE:   
To establish process for OR and NM departments to follow during the Manipulation or Removal of  
radioactive therapeutic agents.  (i.e Brachytherapy) 
 
POLICY:   
 
In the event that radioactive material must be manipulated or explanted, consult Nuclear 
Medicine a minimum of one day prior to surgery to determine potential hazards based on the 
type of radioactive material used and time since implantation.  
 
Gather necessary information from the patient such as: 
1)            Date of implant 
2)            Type of radiation used 
 
Based on the information you may require a lead lined container for the specimen, label 
radioactive, and have nuclear medicine clear the operating room post procedure.  If there is 
still radioactivity, the Nuclear Medicine department will store the radioactive material until it 
returns to background levels.  It will then be disposed of in biohazardous waste container.
