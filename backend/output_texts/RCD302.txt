POLICY: Weekly progress notes are entered into Epic by the case managers to document 
involvement and intervention with families, referrals to various agencies, discharge 
planning, and to note potential problems which may impact patients’ rehabilitation stay 
and/or discharge. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
1. An initial note is made in the chart documenting that case manager has communicated with patient 
and family. 
2. After assessment has been completed with family, case manager documents goals that patient and 
family have for the patient’s rehabilitation. 
3. Case Manager then documents the results of the staffing, goals, and treatment plans set forth by the 
team.  Family and patient goals are shared with the team. 
4. Case management will report the goals and treatment plan to the patient/family to ensure that there is 
clear understanding of the treatment plans and goals.  If patient and family do not understand the 
plans or disagree, this must be documented along with specific reasons for their concern. 
5. Case Manager must carefully document all contacts with insurance carriers including verbal and 
written reports. 
6. Case manager subsequently documents each team conference and the resulting reports to the 
patient/family to keep them informed of patient’s progress. 
7. The patient’s weekly team conference report becomes a permanent part of the patient’s medical 
record.
