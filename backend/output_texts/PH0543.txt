1. Overview and Scope 
1.1. This policy describes the Sterile Compounding Program quality assurance and quality control 
responsibilities and processes for FMOLHS Baton Rouge Market Pharmacies where Compounded 
Sterile Preparations (CSPs) are compounded, verified, and stored prior to dispensing. The policy 
serves as FMOLHS Baton Rouge Market Pharmacies’ written Quality Assurance and Control 
Program (“Quality Program”) consisting of:   
• Quality Assurance (QA) : The procedures, activities, and oversight that ensures the 
compounding process consistently meets quality standards 
• Quality Control (QC): The sampling, testing, and documentation of results that, when taken 
together, ensure CSP specifications have been met prior to release and dispensing 
1.2. The Quality Program is a comprehensive system that supports continual quality improvement 
within the Sterile Compounding Program and is designed to ensure: 
• Regulatory and statutory compliance 
• Adherence to policies and procedures 
• Prevention and detection of errors or other quality deficiencies 
• Evaluation and handling of complaints and adverse events 
• Appropriate investigations and corrective actions 
1.3. The Quality Program integrates information and data collected from patients, caregivers, and 
providers; compounding and support personnel; technical, mechanical, and scientific 
professionals; and supporting organizational and industry experts with the ulti mate goal of 
ensuring patient safety through consistent and repeatable high quality CSPs prepared in a safe 
and controlled compounding environment.  
2. Policy  
2.1. The Designated Person(s) is responsible to define, implement, and oversee FMOLHS Baton Rouge 
Market Pharmacies’ Quality Program and ensure it includes, at a minimum, the following 
integrated components: • Compounding Personnel Training & Competency Evaluation 
• Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
• Compliance Documentation Review & Audit 
• CSP Verification 
• CSP Release Inspections & Testing 
• Controlled Area(s) Cleaning, Disinfecting, & Safety 
• CSP Containers, Packaging, Repackaging, Labeling, and Storage Practices 
• Responsible Personnel 
2.2. Sterile Compounding Program compliance related activities and documentation (e.g., inspection 
or analytical laboratory reports, competency forms and checklists, electronic and written 
records, and supporting documentation) are reviewed and audited at least once annually to 
ensure: 
• All required regulatory and statutory sterile compounding requirements are successfully 
completed within the appropriate timeframe, memorialized with the appropriate 
documentation, and reviewed by the DP (if appropriate) 
• Out of specification findings, occurrences, and events are investigated and remediated 
• Corrective actions are fully documented, and data collected in response to corrective 
actions is reviewed to confirm action taken have been effective 
• Opportunities of continual process improvement are identified and initiated 
2.3. Sterile compounding personnel performance and technique are audited on a regular and ongoing 
basis to validate compliance with procedures, workflows, and conduct as defined in Sterile 
Compounding Program policies and procedures designed to maintain a state  of control in the 
compounding environment and ensure patient safety through the preparation of sterile, 
accurate, and consistent CSPs.

o  5. Definitions 
5.1. Cycle parameters: A description of the unique sterilization or depyrogenation parameters used 
for a defined purpose or process including temperature, duration, and pressure (if appropriate). 
5.2. Cycle validation indicators : including biological indicators and endotoxin challenge vials 
(ECVs) used to validate the respective sterilization or depyrogenation cycles achieved the 
conditions necessary to achieve the desired result in the CSPs or items included in the cycle; is 
not absolute proof of sterility (or depyrogenation). 
5.3. Load characteristics : A description and visual representation/diagram of each sterilization or 
depyrogenation process such as maximum number of items loaded, configuration and placement 
of items inside the load, and wrapping, if any, of the loaded items  
5.4. Oversight: The review, monitoring, and supervision of actions taken by personnel, bearing 
responsibility for those actions, and being available for consultation if and when needed even if 
not physically present. 
5.5. Quality assurance (QA): A system of procedures, activities, and oversight that ensures that the 
compounding process consistently meets quality standards.  
5.6. Quality control (QC): The sampling, testing, and documentation of results that, taken together, 
ensure that specifications have been met before release of the CSP. 
5.7. Release inspection and testing:  Visual inspection and testing performed to ensure that a 
preparation meets appropriate quality characteristics. 
5.8. Specification: The tests, analytical methods, and acceptance criteria to which any component, 
CSP, container closure system, equipment, or other material used in compounding CSPs must 
conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. 
5.9. Verify: To confirm that a method, process, system, or equipment will perform as expected under 
the conditions of actual use.
