Process for:  
• Admissions will email a Delay and Defer Log each day to the following distribution group: 
LakeDelayDeferLog@fmolhs.org  at 12 pm, 3pm, and 5 pm each business day (Monday-Friday). 
• The service line administrators are responsible for providing the delay and defer list to the 
appropriate office. Each office should get information on their patients alone.  
• Beginning, June 1, 2021, at 3pm, Admissions will contact the MD office for any patients 
remaining on the log to inform them that we have not received authorization for their case and 
inform the office that they will need to reschedule the procedure and notify the patient of the 
schedule changes.  
• It is the office’s responsibility to provide admissions with the authorization number after 3pm. 
Offices should send authorization numbers to the LakeDelayDeferLog@fmolhs.org.  
• Admissions will email the distribution group: LakeDelayDeferSurgeryCancellation@fmolhs.org at 
5 pm with instructions on who to cancel from the OR schedule or if there are no patients to 
cancel. OR scheduling will follow instructions indicated on the 5pm email from admissions.   
• If a service line administrator wishes to intercede and keep a case scheduled, they must 
communicate using the distribution group emails above so that everyone is on the same page 
regarding the plan for the patient. Service line administrators are part of the 
LakeDelayDeferSurgeryCancellation group.  
• It is the offices responsibility to communicate with the patient about rescheduling and/or when 
to arrive to OLOL for surgery.  
• Refer to Urgent/Emergent process for process regarding non-elective cases.
