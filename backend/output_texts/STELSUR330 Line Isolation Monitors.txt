I. DESCRIPTION 
 
Electrical panel with built-in meter used for measuring electrical leakage of current in all circuits 
/outlets connected into it.  A green indicator light indicates the panel is on under normal operating 
conditions. 
 
II. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION 
 
A. All electrical circuits in the panel are monitored for leakage of electrical current.  When 
leakage current exceeds preset valves (3 micro amperes) an audible signal will sound and 
a red hazard light will come on.  The red hazard light will stay on until excess leakage 
conditions are corrected. 
 
B. When this hazard condition exists, it does not necessarily mean an immediate danger, but 
one that must be corrected as soon as possible. 
 
C. Common alarm triggering causes:  faulty plugs, an electrical “short” in an equipment 
cord, faulty equipment.  Immediately unplug the equipment that has triggered the alarm 
and remove from service for inspection /repair. 
 
 
III. WHEN THIS DEVICE INDICATES A HAZARD 
 
A. Use of any additional electrical equipment should be avoided, particularly the last 
electrical item put into use (that set off the alarm) as well as any items not required for 
patient monitoring or support. 
 
B. Hospital maintenance/ plant services  shall be notified immediately. 
 
C. Room is not used until hazard condition is corrected.
