TELEPHONE CALLS 
 
     The telephones in the Nutritional Services Department are to be used for hospital 
business and communication purposes between the departments and Nursing Service Units.  
Nutritional Services employees will make a personal telephone call over Medical Center 
lines only in case of emergency.  If an employee receives a phone call, the office personnel 
receiving the call will take the message and relay the message to the employee's Supervisor.  
The Supervisor will then relay the message to the employee. Employees may return or make 
a phone call during break time or lunchtime on a pay phone in the Medical Center  or on 
personal cell phones.
