Send completed form to InfectionControlDept@ololrmc.com
Type A 
Inspection and Non-Invasive Activities. Includes but is not limited to: 
• Removal of ceiling tiles for visual inspection only, e.g. limited to 2 tiles per 50 square
feet
• Painting (not sanding)
• Wall covering, electrical trim work, minor plumbing, and activities which do not
generate dust or require cutting of walls or access to ceilings other that for visual
inspections
• Minimal noise/vibration generated
Type B 
Small scale, short duration activities which create minimal dust. Includes but is not limited to: 
• Installation of telephone and computer cabling
• Access to chase spaces
• Cutting of walls or ceiling where dust migration can be controlled
• Minimal noise/vibration generated
Type C 
Work that generates a moderate to high level of dust or requires demolition or removal of any 
fixed building components or assemblies. Includes but is not limited to: 
• Sanding of walls for painting or wall covering
• Removal of floorcoverings, ceiling tile and casework
• New wall construction
• Minor duct work or electrical work above ceilings
• Major cabling activities
• Any activity which cannot be completed within a single work shift
• Moderate to high levels of noise/vibration generated during demolition or new
construction phases
Type D 
Major demolition and construction projects. Includes but is not limited to: 
• Activities which require consecutive work shifts
• Requires heavy demolition or removal of a complete cabling system
• New construction
High levels of noise/vibration generated during demolition and or new construction phases.

CLASS I 
1.    Every measure will be taken to prevent airborne dust from dispersing into environment. 
2.    Ceiling tiles displaced during construction will be immediately replaced. 
3.    All construction dust will be cleaned at the end of each shift.  
4.    Upon completion of work, area will be vacuumed or cleaned with wet mop.

dispersing into atmosphere. (Dust wall if applicable) 
2. Remove or isolate HVAC system in areas where work is 
being performed.

project is thoroughly cleaned. 
9. Vacuum work with HEPA-filtered vacuums. 
10. Wet mop with disinfectant 
11. Remove barrier materials carefully to minimize spreading 
of dirt and debris associated with construction. 
12. Contain construction waste before transport in tightly 
covered containers. 
13. Cover transport receptacles or carts. Tape covering.  
14. Advise staff in affected area of potential for 
noise/vibration, and expected activity duration. 
CLASS IV 
 
1. Isolate HVAC system in area where work is being done 
to prevent contamination of duct system. 
2. Complete all critical barriers or implement control cube 
method before construction begins.

pressure is maintained. 
6. Seal holes, pipes, conduits and punctures appropriately. 
7. Place sticky step-off dust-mat at entrance and exit of 
work area 
8. Construct anteroom and require all personnel to pass 
through this room so they can be vacuumed using a 
HEPA vacuum cleaner before leaving worksite or they 
can wear cloth or paper coveralls that are removed 
each time they leave the worksite.
