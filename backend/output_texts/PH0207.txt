POLICY: 
Medication therapy monitoring shall be an ongoing, prospective or concurrent process to assure effective, 
appropriate, and safe medication therapy.  Medication therapy monitoring shall be a collaborative 
assessment by physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other practitioners responsible for the patient.  The 
goal of pharmacotherapy should be to use the least number and the smallest dose of medications to provide 
a maximal decrease in a patient’s symptoms and functional improvement with minimal adverse effects. 
 
COLLECTION, USE, AND COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANT PATIENT MEDICATION 
INFORMATION 
The pharmacy shall collect, use, and communicate important patient medication information through the 
review of medication orders, monitoring the patient's medication regimen (patient profile), monitoring 
laboratory findings relevant to medication therapy,  reconciliation of pharmacy and nursing records, and, 
when requested, patient medication histories. 
 
MONITORING THE PATIENT'S MEDICATION REGIMEN 
Medication therapy monitoring shall include a review of the patient's medication regimen for:
• Effectiveness of medication therapy 
• Allergies and adverse effects 
• Toxicity 
• Renal function and or hepatic function 
• Potential interactions and contraindications 
• Duplicate therapy (e.g., anti-infectives) 
• Interferences and incompatibilities

• Appropriate dose, frequency, and route of 
administration 
• Other irregularities or departures from what 
is considered usual or appropriate 
MONITORING FOR EXCESSIVE PRESCRIBING (POLY-PHARMACY)

pharmacy).  Medications often associated with excessive prescribing include but are not limited to:

MONITORING LABORATORY FINDINGS 
In addition to reviewing the medication regimen, monitoring shall include current laboratory findings 
relevant to medication therapy. 
 
MONITORING THE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS ON PATIENTS 
The pharmacy shall work with the medical staff and nursing service to monitor the effects of medications.  
The pharmacy shall note adverse effects as well as subtherapeutic effects.  The pharmacy shall participate 
in the facility's adverse drug reaction reporting program to help identify problems to resolve or processes 
to improve, and work within the framework of the organization-wide performance improvement program 
to improve the detection and reporting of adverse drug reactions and to reduce the incidenc e of adverse 
drug reactions. 
 
COMMUNICATION TO PRESCRIBERS, NURSES, AND OTHERS 
The pharmacy shall inform prescribers, nurses, and others, as appropriate, of any potential irregularities 
or adverse events and other important patient medication information identified in monitoring medication 
therapy.  When appropriate, the pharmacy shall suggest modifications of medication orders (e.g., changing 
the medication, changing the dose, and changing the timing of administration).
