PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this policy is to prevent the spread of infection by properly managing 
blood and body fluid spills.  All department heads and supervisory personnel are 
responsible for ensuring that their employees are prepared to properly respond to spills of 
potentially infectious materials such as blood/body fluids in their work area. Each 
department will maintain proper spill clean-up equipment at all times. If necessary, due to 
the volume of the spill, notify the Housekeeping Department to disinfect the area. 
 
POLICY: 
Standard Precautions will be implemented in all circumstances by the person(s) cleaning 
the spill.  Decontamination and cleaning materials shall include but not be limited to EPA 
registered disinfectant, and other appropriate cleaning equipment (i.e., cleaning cloths, 
towels, etc.).  Broken glassware will not be picked up by hands.  The use of mechanical 
means such as brooms, dustpans, brushes, tongs, or forceps will be utilized.  
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. The department where the spill occurs will be responsible for the initial clean-up 
using a hospital approved disinfectant.  Spill clean-up will be done by employees 
trained in the use of Standard Precautions.  
 
2. The area involved in the spill will be restricted to patient, visitor, and staff until the 
clean-up and disinfection efforts are completed. 
 
3. Assemble materials and equipment to include such items as gloves, cleaning cloths, 
paper towels, hospital-approved disinfectant, biohazard bags, and bags for linens 
contaminated with infectious waste. Put on personal protective equipment (PPE) as 
required. 
 
4. Remove bulk amount of blood/body fluid with an absorbent rag or towel and dispose 
of in the appropriate receptacle (linens in soiled linen bag and paper towels in the 
biohazard bag).  The area can then be cleaned with a hospital approved disinfectant 
solution. 
 
5. If necessary, after the bulk amount of blood/body fluid has been removed, notify the 
Housekeeping Department to disinfect the area. 
 
6. Remove PPE and dispose of properly. 
 
7. Wash hands.
