POLICY: A patient who is self-mutilating may be subject to the following protocol for their safety.  
  
PROCEDURE:  
1. At the time self-mutilation is discovered, the nurse will place the patient in a green paper scrubs 
or green hospital gown and remove all belongings from the patientâ€™s room.  The nurse should 
explain to the patient the justification for the use of the scrubs or gown, removal of belongings, 
and process for discontinuing the protocol.  
2. A complete skin assessment should be completed each shift for 48 hours after an event of self-
mutilation is discovered. 
3. The patient should remain in a gown for 48 hours after any event of self-mutilation. Upon 
completion of the skin assessment after 48 hours, with no sign of new self-injury, the patient will 
receive the bottom article of their clothing. The patient will be reassessed 4 hours later and may 
then receive additional clothing items. If self-mutilation occurs at any point in this sequence, the 
process will start over.  
4. Patients should wear underwear (female patients cannot wear bras with wires) and should have 
their feet covered.
