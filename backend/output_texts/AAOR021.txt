PURPOSE: To provide an optical imaging policy for the retention of research records in accordance with 
applicable federal, state and local regulations, guidelines, specific grant, contract requirements the 
Hospital’s record management policy (LEG.04.001).   
 
GENERAL: The Office of Research may electronically image original documents and destroy the hard 
copies in order to:  1) promote the efficient storage, retrieval, organization and retention of records; 2) 
reduce the use of the physical storage of original documents, 3) reduce insurance expenses; and 4) ease 
the process of locating documents. For industry-sponsored research, the Office of Research must have 
written permission from the study sponsor to retain research records in electronic form upon completion 
of the research study. Original hard copy records deemed not suitable for optical imaging shall be 
physically retained in accordance with written guidelines applicable to all research records.   Once 
scanned according to the Optical-imaging policy, the original hard copy documents may be destroyed in 
the regular course of business.  
 
POLICY: 
1. Hard copy research records will 
a. contain the date that the original was created; revision dates, and when the record was scanned. 
b. identify who handled the records and by whom the original was scanned. 
c. be imaged in accordance with standard procedures.  
d. be duplicated exactly, including the color, highlights, shading and other peculiarities of the 
original (such as, frayed, torn edges, discoloration of document) into an FMOLHS approved 
optical imaging storing system (i.e. ImageNow).  
 
2. The storage system of imaged research documents will  
a. assure that the original integrity of the document is maintained without potential for physical 
alteration. 
b. save and log research documents using a reliable and retrievable method. 
c. be username and password protected, with limited monitored document access. 
d. maintain the intact document for its required storage life (LEG.04.001).  
e. be secure and backed up according to FMOLHS policy. 
 
3. Research records may be purged at the culmination of their required storage life; however, the method 
of record retention chosen must assure that research records will not be purged based on archival 
inactivity.
