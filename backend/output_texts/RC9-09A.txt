Purpose 
To properly read theSiemens Epoc equipment in order to be assured correct values are 
obtained. 
 
Equipment 
A. Epoc Reader 
B. Epoc Host 
C. Epoc Test Card 
 
Calibrations 
Calibration fluid is contained in each epoc Test Card within a sealed reservoir.  Each 
epoc Test Card has a barcode which identifies the card type, serial number, lot number 
and expiration date.  After insertion, the Test Card engagement process activates a motor 
that displaces a valve plug in the card to open the cardâ€™s sealed calibrator reservoir and 
then displaces calibration fluid from the reservoir to the measurement region, which is the 
fluidic channel above the sensor module in the card. This process will occur prior to each 
blood sample analysis. An analog-to-digital converter converts all analog signals into 
digital form and then to a wireless transmittable Bluetooth format.  The signals are then 
transmitted by the epoc Reader to the epoc Host. The system performs calibrations 
automatically when a new test card is inserted in the epoc Reader.  The operator is not 
required to take any action for this calibration to occur. The calibration methodology may 
be further reviewed in the epoc System Standard Operating Procedure Manual beginning 
on page 3-5.   
 
Errors in calibration 
If the system detects a problem for a parameter, the system will not analyze a blood 
sample.  The user will discard the epoc Test Card that failed calibration and a new card 
will be used.  In the event of multiple failed calibrations, the manufacturer will be 
contacted for servicing of analyzer.
