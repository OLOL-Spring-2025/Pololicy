1. PURPOSE -- SCOPE 
Provide guidelines for disposition of managed equipment including associated PHI storage devices. 
This applies to all TRIMEDX Associates and all managed equipment in, or intended to be in, the TRIMEDX 
CMMS. 
2. REFERENCE DOCUMENTS 
3. DEFINITIONS 
3.1. Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) – TRIMEDX uses RSQ as its maintenance 
management system. 
3.2. Covered Entity – Health care providers involved in the transmission of protected health information 
(PHI). This transmission can take place for the purpose of payment, treatment, operations, billing, or 
insurance coverage. Covered entities can include organizations, institutions, or persons. 
3.3. Decommissioned – A sub-status of the managed equipment record. Device is rendered inoperable 
and cannot be returned to service at any hospital/facility. 
3.4. Disposition – The deactivation of the device from the CMMS and physical removal of said device 
from the environment of care and availability for patient use at its current inventory location. 
3.5. Disposition of Equipment Form (DEF) – The form required to receive the HAA approval of the device 
to be dispositioned and to ensure the removal of PHI from the device if identified by HAA. 
3.6. Inactive – A sub-status of the device record contained in the CMMS defined as a device that is in 
operating order but is being removed from hospital/facility inventory. The device can be reactivated 
and used at another hospital/facility or reactivated at current hospital/facility with proper 
performance verification and equipment record updates. 
3.7. Managed (Covered) equipment – Any device, equipment or tool that is actively managed under a 
TRIMEDX contract by virtue of it being included in the CMMS inventory. This is inclusive of associated 
PHI storage devices. 
3.8. PHI Storage Device – Any component contained within or attached to managed equipment, or the 
entire piece of equipment, identified as having the potential to contain PHI. 
3.9. Protected Health Information (PHI) / Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) - Protected 
health information is the term given to health data created, received, stored, or transmitted by 
HIPAA covered entities and their business associates in relation to the provision of healthcare, 
healthcare operations and payment for healthcare services. Protected health information is often 
shortened to PHI, or in the case of electronic health information, ePHI. 
3.10. RUDR – A proprietary TRIMEDX algorithm that recommends when equipment should be replaced, 
upgraded, decommissioned, or reallocated.

dispositioned at the same point in time. All unique combinations will require that this process be 
completed with a separate form. 
• TRIMEDX Associates will not be responsible for deciding the reason and type for the disposition of 
managed equipment. Should a TRIMEDX Associate act as the Disposition Requestor, it shall be at the 
request of the HAA, and it is the responsibility of the HAA to review and approve the disposition reason 
and type as documented. 
This procedure describes the specific requirements of TRIMEDX Associates for the disposition of managed 
equipment or certain components of equipment that is actively inventoried in the TRIMEDX CMMS. 
If HAA or Hospital IT Department Representative/Customer Designated Representative declines to sign or 
complete any aspect of the policy and procedure, the TRIMEDX associate shall document the reason in the 
work notes and notify the TRIMEDX Site Manager who shall cancel the Disposition WO/WOT in CMMS and 
inform the TRIMEDX Director. 
Should a deviation from the policy and procedure be deemed necessary, the deviation must be formally 
requested and documented with specific, defensible rationale supporting the request including, but not 
limited to, the reason for the deviation, why the policy and procedure cannot be followed, scope, risks, 
and duration. The request shall first be presented to the TRIMEDX Division Vice President who will review, 
approve, or reject. If approved, it will then be presented by the TRIMEDX Division Vice President to the 
TRIMEDX Vice President of Legal and Vice President, Quality & Regulatory Compliance to review and 
approve or reject. Deviations should be infrequent and typically the result of special cause variation and 
are allowed in order to help the business address unanticipated circumstances in a reasonable way.
