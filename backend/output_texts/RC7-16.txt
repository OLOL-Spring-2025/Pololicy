PURPOSE: 
To increase the alveolar oxygen tension: 
A. Reversing and preventing tissue hypoxia 
B. Treating arterial hypoxemia 
C. Decreasing the work of breathing 
D. Decreasing the myocardial work 
 
PROCEDURE: 
A. Oxygen therapy will be delivered by respiratory therapist or nursing.   
B. All oxygen therapy will be ordered in accordance with the FMOLHS approved 
    oxygen therapy protocol unless otherwise ordered by the physician. 
C. Weaning of oxygen therapy will be performed by respiratory therapist or nursing 
     as per protocol. 
D. Weaning should be attempted no less frequently than Q shift and documented in 
the patient’s EMR. 
      
E. Documentation must be completed with each assessment and with titration of  
    oxygen therapy.  Documentation must include the patient SpO2, liter per minute  
    flow rate and/or the FiO2.  If the oxygen is not in use but the patient is still  
    ordered oxygen therapy per protocol, the therapist or nurse may indicate that the  
    oxygen device is on “standby.” 
F. Replace any device or humidifier as needed.   
 
PHYSIOLOGICAL HAZARDS OF OXYGEN THERAPY: 
Oxygen is a drug and should be handled as one. 
A. Absorption atelectasis 
B. Retinopathy of the Newborn 
C. Oxygen toxicity 
D. Oxygen induced hypoventilation 
E. Drying of respiratory mucosa 
F. Psychological dependence 
     
PHYSICAL HAZARDS OF OXYGEN THERAPY: 
Oxygen supports combustion and therefore any flame in an oxygen-enriched area will 
burn more vigorously.
