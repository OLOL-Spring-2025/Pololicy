and reviewed pursuant to agreed-upon terms. 
POLICY: 
The pharmacy may delegate certain functions of its program services through a formal written agreement.  [URAC 
OPIN 1-2 (a, b)] 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
Delegation is the process by which the organization contracts with or otherwise arranges for another entity to perform 
functions and to assume responsibilities covered under these standards on behalf of the organization, and the 
organization retains final authority to provide oversight to the delegate. 
PROCEDURE: [URAC OPIN 1-2 (a, b)] 
A. When the pharmacy delegates functions under the scope of their affiliated accreditation standards, the 
phar
macy retains accountability to the accreditation agencies for the contracted functions. The pharmacy 
maintains executed agreements with delegated entity. [URAC OPIN 1-2 (a)]

complete at least annual audits of the delegated entities services to include Patient Management Program 
documentation until that delegated entity receives their own required accreditation to cover the scope of 
services provided. Upon proof of that accreditation from the delegated entity, auditing of documentation will be 
optional as the accreditation will demonstrate compliance with necessary standards/elements of performance 
applicable to the delegated functions. [URAC OPIN 1-2 (b)]  
 
C. Delegated entities with a specified accreditation must promptly notify the pharmacy of any changes in its 
accreditation or certification status.
