PATIENT TLC PROGRAM 
 
The purpose of this program is to ensure 100% accuracy for those patients who have been 
identified with special needs or concerns. When a manager or supervisor places a patient on 
the TLC program, the following procedures are implemented. 
 
1. A current list will be maintained in the office. The person who places the patient 
on the program is responsible for writing the patient’s name along with their 
current room number in the call center. 
 
2. The operator is responsible for identifying patients as a TLC using CBORD (in 
the notes section). All patients’ tickets designated as a TLC are compared to the 
TLC patient list by the office clerks prior to each meal. 
 
3. The person responsible for reviewing the tray tickets is 100% responsible for     
the accuracy of the menu items based on the information on the diet list. If the 
patient is to receive meals at a specific time or late tray, the ticket is to be handed 
to a supervisor. 
 
4. Each time a TLC Menu is sent down the line, the trayline checker announces the 
TLC menu.  The supervisor is to review the menu, checking off each item, and 
initial the ticket. 
 
5. Patients still having difficulty will receive a hand delivered tray which will be 
reconciled with the patient when it is delivered to insure the patient is completely 
satisfied with the tray.
