 PURPOSE: 
The Purpose of this policy is to describe the process to be followed if a patient wishes to leave the Our 
Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOLRMC) voluntarily against the advice of the attending 
physician. 
 
POLICY: 
Patients desiring to leave OLOLRMC against medical advice will be asked to read and sign the 
appropriate "AMA Release" form. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. When the patient notifies the nursing staff that he/she is leaving OLOLRMC voluntarily without 
being discharged or against the advice of the physician, the nursing staff requests that the 
patient sign the appropriate "AMA Release" form (#5411), witnesses the signature, and dates 
and times the form. 
 
2. The attending and consulting physicians are notified that the patient is leaving OLOLRMC 
voluntarily, without being discharged and/or against medical advice. 
 
3. If a patient is PEC/CEC they are not allowed to leave AMA. 
 
4.  If the patient refuses to sign the form, a notation to that effect is documented on the form and in 
the patientâ€™s medical record. 
 
5.  If the patient leaves the hospital without notifying the staff and does not return, description of 
the incident is described in the patient medical record. 
 
6. A member of the nursing staff who is knowledgeable about the incident completes a Safety 
Event Report, preferably before the patient leaves the hospital. 
 
7. The patient should then be discharged from the OLOLRMC electronic medical record.
