PANDEMIC INFLUENZA 
 
See also ECEP008 – Mass Influx of Infectious Patients Plan – Appendix B. Pandemic Influenza 
 
No one can precisely predict the timing or the virus strain that might trigger a global flu pandemic.  No one knows 
with certainty how long it will take to identify the virus strain, develop an effective vaccine against it, or distribute it to 
the population. 
 
Pre-Pandemic Vaccine: 
▪ There is the development of pre-pandemic vaccines based on current lethal strains of H5N1  
▪ The Food and Drug Administration has approved a vaccine based on an early strain of the H5N1 virus that is 
not commercially available, but is being added to the Strategic National Stockpile 
 
Influenza Antiviral Drugs: 
▪ Antiviral drugs such as: 
o  Amantadine (Symmetrel) and Rimantadine (Flumadine) are approved for treatment and prevention of 
influenza A,  
o Zanamivir (Relenza) and Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) are approved for treatment of acute 
uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B and approved for preventive use. 
o The H5N1 virus that has caused human illness and death is Asia is resistant to Amantadine and 
Rimantadine. Studies have not been completed to evaluate the effectiveness of other antiviral drugs 
o Antiviral drugs may be in limited supply 
o The effectiveness of antiviral drugs will only be known definitively once the pandemic is underway. 
▪ Antiviral regimens are only recommended for use with the treatment of ill persons.  There is no 
recommendation to use antiviral agents as prophylaxis.  Prophylaxis would have to continue for up to six 
weeks and there would be no protection once the medication ends.

How to Mix 100 milligram (mg) Doxycycline with a Food or Drink 
 
Note: To find out how much of this mixture to give a child, use the Dosing Chart below. 
 
The following instructions should be followed using measuring spoons that measure one (1) 
teaspoon and one half (1/2) teaspoon if they are available.  If measuring spoons are not 
available, please use the same metal teaspoon to grind the tablet, measure the food or drink, 
and give the medicine.  For example, if you do not have a measuring spoon to give the child one 
and a half (1 ½) teaspoons of the medicine mixture, use the metal teaspoon to estimate as best 
you can.  Because the amount of fluid is so small in a half teaspoon, it is better to give a little 
extra of the half teaspoon than not enough. 
 
You will need: 
• One (1) 100 mg Doxycycline tablet 
• 1 metal teaspoon 
• Measuring spoons one (1) teaspoon, one half (1/2) teaspoon (if available) 
• 1 or 2 small bowls 
• One of these foods or drinks 
o Low fat milk 
o Low fat chocolate milk 
o Regular (whole) chocolate milk 
o Apple juice mixed with sugar* 
 
 
*If you use apple juice mixed with table sugar: 
 
1. Use a measuring spoon to put four (4) level teaspoons of sugar and four (4) teaspoons 
of apple juice in a second small bowl 
2. Stir the mixture until all the sugar is dissolved – it may take several minutes. 
3. Using the measuring spoon, add four (4) teaspoons of the juice and sugar mixture into 
the first bowl with the Doxycycline powder from one (1) 100 mg tablet.  Mix them 
together until the Doxycycline powder dissolves. 
 
 
1. Grind the Doxycycline tablet into powder. 
 
Put one (1) 100 mg Doxycycline tablet into a small bowl and grind it into a fine powder 
using the back of the metal teaspoon.  The powder should not have any large pieces. 
 
2. Mix the Doxycycline powder from one (1) 100 mg tablet with four (4) teaspoons of a food 
or drink. 
 
Use a measuring spoon to add four (4) level teaspoons of a food or drink to the 
Doxycycline powder in the small bowl.  Mix them together until the Doxycycline powder 
dissolves.  It may be harder to dissolve the powder in pudding than in a drink.

Doses: How Much of the Doxycycline Mixture to Give a Child 
 
Adults (and children heavier than 100 pounds) who are exposed to anthrax should take one (1) 
100 mg tablet of Doxycycline twice a day for 60 days (2 tablets per day) 
 
The number of teaspoons of the Doxycycline mixture to give a child depends on the child’s 
weight.  Use the chart below to see how much to give a child. 
 
Dosing Chart for Doxycycline Mixture 
 
This chart shows you the amount to give a child for one dose.  You should give a child two 
doses (one in the morning and one in the evening) each day for 60 days.  Use measuring 
spoons to measure the dose accurately. 
 
Oral Dosing Regimen for One Dose 
If the child weighs Give the child Which is 
0-12.5 lbs One half (1/2) teaspoon of 
the Doxycycline mixture 
12.5 mg of Doxycycline

87.5-100 lbs Four (4) teaspoons of the 
Doxycycline mixture 
100 mg of Doxycycline 
 
 
How to Store Foods Mixed with Doxycycline 
 
Doxycycline mixed with any of the recommended foods and drinks will keep for at least 24 
hours.  Store the mixture in a covered container and always refrigerate the mixtures made 
with milk or pudding.  Mixtures made with juice can be stored at room temperature.  FDA 
recommends that Doxycycline mixtures be prepared daily; unused portions should be thrown 
away.
