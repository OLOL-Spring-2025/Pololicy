Documentation of this approval will be kept in their personnel file (see Appendix A).

to be high value or a high risk for diversion as determined by the Director of Pharmacy in conjunction with the 
Medication Use Committee. Certain keys may be stored in the CII safe for tracking purposes.  These may include 
but are not limited to:  
• PCA keys
