PURPOSE: 
To provide phlebotomy support for patients, guests, or other persons needing urgent medical treatment in the 
event of an emergency.  Patients may not have available patient information and an identification system that is 
able to support immediate diagnosis and treatment will be required. 
 
Addresses: 
Supervisors 
Venipuncture Charge Techs 
Venipuncture Phlebotomist 
 
POLICY: 
Phlebotomists in the Venipuncture Department are members of the following Code/Trauma Teams and are 
responsible for immediately reporting to the following codes: (this list is not inclusive, and a phlebotomist may be 
asked to respond to other codes not listed) 
• Code Blue 
• Code D / ECU Surge 
• Code FAST 
• Code Green 
• ECU Stroke Alert 
• Heart Alert CVL 
• Heart Alert ECU 
• Trauma Alert Level 1 
• Trauma Alert Level 2 
• Trauma Alert Level 3 
 
PROCEDURE: 
➢ The Charge Phlebotomist assigns  phlebotomist  to report to the Code immediately with required 
phlebotomy supplies 
➢ During hours when a phlebotomist is not assigned to the ECU, the charge phlebotomist will assign a 
phlebotomist to report to Trauma and/or ECU Codes 
➢ Phlebotomist draws the patient as directed by the Code/Trauma Team
