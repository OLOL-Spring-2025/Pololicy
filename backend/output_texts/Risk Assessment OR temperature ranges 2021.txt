AORN and ASHRE 
indicate approved 
humidity and 
temperature ranges to 
include 
 -Humidity 30%-60% 
 -Temperature 68-75◦ F 
 
Requests and need for 
temperatures outside of 
established range in 
operating rooms 
 
 
SOS010 – Environmental 
Controls has detailed 
algorithm on intervening 
in the event of humidity 
values out of range. 
 
APIC guide 2018 – 
evidence suggesting a 
relationship between 
ambient room 
temperature in the OR 
and infections is weak to 
nonexistent. 
 
Temperature can cause 
sweating and cognitive 
risks creating unsafe 
environment. 
 
How temperature affects 
humidity and potential 
condensation can 
increase contamination 
risk 
 
 
Failure to 
maintain 
appropriate 
temperature 
can potentially 
have a negative 
impact on 
patient safety 
and pose the 
following risks 
to the patient 
population: 
 
Hypothermia 
potential for 
increased risk of 
- delayed 
wound healing  
-Lowered 
immune 
response 
-Bleeding 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypothermia 
-Non healing 
surgical sites & 
lowered immune 
response 
increases risk for 
infection. 
 
-bleeding alters 
hemodynamic 
status  
 
Humidity 
could affect 
compliance to the 
equipment 
manufacturer’s 
recommendations 
for use and thus 
compromise the 
integrity and 
proper use of the 
equipment.  
 
may affect the 
integrity of the 
sterile items and 
cause infection 
due to the use of 
 
Patient 
warming 
devices and 
monitoring 
techniques 
used to 
maintain 
normothermia  
 
Established

Action plan:    
• Include how we are mitigating risks 
o Follow algorithm in Policy SOS010 when HVAC fails 
o Assess and monitor patient’s ability to maintain normothermia using warming devices
