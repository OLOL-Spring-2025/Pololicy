PURPOSE:    
To define how victims of sexually-oriented criminal offenses will be registered and how billing 
will be handled. To ensure compliance with Louisiana law regarding billing for victims of 
sexually-oriented criminal offenses. 
 
 
POLICY: 
The facility will not directly bill a victim of a sexually-oriented criminal offense for any 
healthcare services rendered in conducting a forensic medical examination.  Expenses include: 
 (a) Forensic examiner and hospital or healthcare facility services directly related to the exam, 
including integral forensic supplies. 
 (b) Scope procedures directly related to the forensic exam including but not limited to anoscopy and 
colposcopy. 
 (c) Laboratory testing directly related to the forensic examination, including drug screening, 
urinalysis, pregnancy screening, syphilis screening, chlamydia culture, gonorrhea coverage 
culture, blood test for HIV screening, hepatitis B and C, herpes culture, and any other sexually 
transmitted disease testing directly related to the forensic examination. 
 (d) Any medication provided during the forensic medical examination. 
 
When the facility may bill the patient's insurer:  The facility will obtain consent from the 
victim of a sexually-oriented criminal offense before billing the patient’s commercial health 
insurance issuer, e.g. Blue Cross, for the forensic medical exam.  If the patient consents to 
billing his/her health insurance, the health insurance issuer shall waive any applicable co-pays, 
deductibles, and co-insurance, and the facility will submit a claim to the Crime Victims 
Reparation Board for non-covered services, once the health insurance processes the claim; 
however, not to exceed $1,000.00. 
 
When the facility may bill the Crime Victim's Reparation's Board:  If the patient does not 
consent to his/her commercial plan being billed, the facility may bill the Crime Victims 
Reparation Board.  If the patient is uninsured, the facility may bill the Crime Victims Reparation 
Board. 
 
When the facility may bill Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare:  If the patient has active 
Medicare, Louisiana Medicaid, or Tricare insurance (including Medicare replacements and 
Bayou Health Medicaid plans), those insurances will be billed as primary. 
  
The facility will provide to any person who presents for treatment as a victim of a sexually-
oriented criminal offense a copy of the pamphlet prepared by DHH outlining an explanation of 
the billing process. 
  
PROCEDURE: 
At Our Lady of the Lake, Livingston, and St Elizabeth hospitals, the insurance plan code “CMV” 
will be used to register victims of a sexually-oriented criminal offense.  The CMV code will alert 
the Business Office to bill according to this policy. 
 
Upon notification by nursing staff that the patient is a victim of asexually-oriented criminal 
offense, Patient Access staff will proceed as follows: 
         
• If the patient has commercial health insurance (e.g. Blue Cross), the Patient Access Rep 
will ask the patient whether he/she wants the insurance billed.  The rep will ask the patient 
to sign a consent form for billing (or not billing) his/her health insurance.  If the victim 
consents, the Patient Access Rep will list the patient’s health insurance as primary and 
“CMV” as secondary or tertiary, as appropriate.  The Rep will select “CRIME VICTIMS, 
REPARATION” as the GUARANTOR.  The Patient Access Rep will NOT ask the patient 
for money. 
• If the victim has commercial health insurance but does not consent to the healthcare 
provider submitting a claim to his/her health insurance issuer, the Patient Access Rep will 
register the patient with “CMV” as the primary insurance.  The Rep will select “CRIME 
VICTIMS, REPARATION” as the GUARANTOR.  The Patient Access Rep will NOT ask 
the patient for money. 
• If the patient has Louisiana Medicaid, Medicare or Tricare, the patient will be registered 
with his/her health insurance as primary and “CMV” as secondary or tertiary.  The Rep will 
select “CRIME VICTIMS, REPARATION” as the GUARANTOR.  The Patient Access 
Rep will NOT ask the patient for money. 
• If the patient is uninsured, the Patient Access Rep will register the patient with “CMV” as 
the primary insurance.  The Rep will select “CRIME VICTIMS, REPARATION” as the 
GUARANTOR.  The Patient Access Rep will NOT ask the patient for money. 
 
Within 48 hours after the patient visits the ED, if the patient changes his/her mind about billing health 
insurance, the Patient Access Rep will direct the patient to visit a Financial Counselor to sign a new 
consent form.  The Financial Counselor will modify the insurance plans as directed by the patient and the 
instructions above. 
 
The Business Office will submit claims to the Crime Reparations Board when “CMV” is listed as 
insurance.  The Business Office will ensure that any balances owed are NOT dropped to a patient bill.
