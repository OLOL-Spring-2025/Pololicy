Title: Fire Safety Guideline for Interventional 
Procedures

PURPOSE: 
To give a guideline for health care team members to prevent fires during interventional procedures.  
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
Though fire management strategies are the responsibility of all members of the 
operative/invasive team, the following chart delineates the person who has control over 
certain areas and assigns primary responsibility. The absence of one or more of these 
designated members does not negate the need for adherence to these actions by other 
members of the team.
