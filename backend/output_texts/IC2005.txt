PURPOSE: To state the rationale and reason for hand hygiene using CDC Guidelines. 
 
POLICY: 
1. All healthcare workers (HCW) will be expected to use appropriate hand hygiene techniques before and 
after patient care and after attending to their personal hygiene. 
 
2. Hand hygiene is the single most important means of preventing the spread of infection. 
 
3.   Alcohol hand sanitizer with 60% alcohol kills 90% of the bacteria/virus on a HCW hands.  This is the 
preferred method of hand hygiene by CDC. Alcohol hand sanitizer is only to be used if t he HCW 
hands are not visi bly soiled.  Alcohol hand sanitizer should not be used by HCW if a patient has 
suspected or confirmed Clostridioides difficile, norovirus, or Bacillus anthracis. 
 
4. Employees should utilize the hand hygiene products as provided by the Medical Center and not allow 
personal substitutes at their discretion. 
 
Handwashing Agents:  
Products used for hand washing will be approved by Infection Prevention and Control and manufacturers' 
recommendations for use are to be followed. 
 
PROCEDURE 
A.   Hand-hygiene techniques  
1. When performing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based hand rub, apply product to palm of one 
hand and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and fingers, until the product has 
dried. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations regarding the volume of product to use.  
2. When washing hands with soap and water, wet hands first with water, apply the recommended 
amount of product to hands, and rub hands together vigorously for at least 15 seconds, covering 
all surfaces of the hands and fingers. Rinse hands with water and dry thoroughly with a 
disposable towel. Use the towel to turn off the faucet, then throw the paper towel away.  Avoid 
using hot water; repeated exposure to hot water may increase the risk of dermatitis. 
B. Indications for hand hygiene     
1. Hand washing is essential when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with material, are 
visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids, and if the patient has diarrhea.  Wash hands with 
soap and water following the above technique.  2 
2. Wash hands with soap and water before eating and after using the restroom. 
3. Wash hands with soap and water if Clostridioides difficile, norovirus or Bacillus anthracis  is 
suspected or confirmed. The physical action of washing and rinsing hands under such 
circumstances is recommended because alcohols, chlorhexidine, iodophors, and other antiseptic 
agents have poor activity against spores.  
4. If hands are not visibly soiled, use an alcohol-based hand rub for routine hand hygiene. 
5. Perform hand hygiene before having direct contact with the patient or the patient’s environment; 
before donning sterile gloves when inserting a central intravascular catheter; before inserting 
indwelling urinary catheters, peripheral vascular catheters, or other invasive devices that do not 
require a surgical procedure; after contact with a patient’s intact skin (e.g., when taking vital 
signs or lifting a patient); if moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site; after 
contact with objects and surfaces (including medical equipment) in the immediate vicinity of the 
patient; and after removing gloves. 
 
6. In the event of interruption of water supply, alternative agents such as detergent -containing 
towelettes and alcohol-based hand rubs will be made available. 
 
7. Products used for hand hygiene should be chosen by persons knowledgeable about the purpose 
of use, the advantages and disadvantages, cost, and acceptance of the product by users. 
 
8. Routine use of hexachlorophene is not recommended. 
 
C. Surgical hand antisepsis  
Refer to Surgical Services Policy SOS030, "Surgical Hand Scrub". 
 
 
D. Other aspects of hand care and protection  
1. Glove use 
a. Gloves should be used as an adjunct to and not a substitute for hand washing. 
b. Gloves should be used for hand -contaminating activities.  Gloves should be removed, and 
hands washed when such activity is completed, when the integrity of the gloves is in doubt, 
and between patients.  Gloves may need to be changed during the care of a single patient  if 
moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site. 
c. Disposable gloves should be used only once and should not be washed or sanitized for reuse. 
 
2. Condition of nails and hands 
a. Nails should be short enough to allow the individual to thoroughly clean underneath them 
and not cause glove tears. 
b. The hands, including the nails and surrounding tissue, should be inflammation free. 
c.   Refer to Infection Control Policy, IC2005a “Artificial Finger Nails” , regarding the use of 
artificial nail enhancements. 
3. Lotion  3 
a. Non-petroleum-based lotions may be used to prevent skin dryness associated with hand 
washing.  HCW are encouraged to use the hospital lotions placed in the nursing stations. 
b. If used, lotion should be supplied in small, individual -use or pump dispenser containers that 
are not refilled. 
c. Compatibility between lotion and antiseptic products and the effect of petroleum or other oil 
emollients on the integrity of gloves should be considered at the time of product selection. 
4. Dispensing of hand care products 
a. Liquid products should be stored in closed containers. 
b. Disposable containers should be used.  
c. There should be a routine mechanism to ensure that soap and towel dispenser function 
properly and are adequately supplied. 
5. Drying of hands 
a. Cloth towels, hanging or roll type, are not recommended for use in health care facilities. 
b. Paper towels or hand blowers should be within easy reach of the sink but beyond splash 
contamination. 
c. Lever-operated towel dispensers should be activated before beginning hand  washing.  Hand 
blowers should be activated with the elbow. 
6. Behavior and compliance   
Efforts to improve hand washing practice should be multifaceted and should include continuing 
education and feedback to staff on behavior or infection surveillance data.  Unit , clinical, and 
administrative staff should be involved in the planning and implementation of strategies to 
improve compliance and handwashing.
