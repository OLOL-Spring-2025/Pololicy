PURPOSE:

all hospital employees, volunteers, physicians/allied health, GME Program Participants, students, and other 
specifically designated healthcare providers, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC). 
 
 
POLICY: 
 
All of the above work groups will be required to receive or show proof of receiving the influenza vaccine 
annually, unless an approved exception is granted. The influenza vaccine will be offered free of charge. 
 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
Prior to the start of the influenza season each year, notification will be sent to how and when the vaccine 
will be made available.  The vaccine will be administered under the direction of the Employee Health 
Department. Annually, the Infection Prevention department will determine the type of vaccine that will be 
made available.

2. Individuals are provided with appropriate Vaccination Immunization (VIS) educational 
material to review prior to receiving the vaccine. 
 
3. Prior to receiving the vaccine , a  consent and medical screening questionnaire, will be 
completed by the person being vaccinated and reviewed by the Employee Health Department 
designee. 
 
4. Evidence of vaccination will be documented in the individual’s Health Record.  Individual’s 
receiving the vaccine will also be issued a colored tag that must be clearly displayed at the top of 
their employee ID badge throughout the entire influenza period.  The colored tag will serve as 
proof of receipt of the vaccine and will exempt those individual’s from having to wear a surgical 
mask or other approved facemask.

area or activity can be re -defined at any time during the flu season by recommendation of the 
Infection Prevention department if an expansion of this policy is necessary.

Office of Public Health and is subject to change during the season but usually is from October 
through March.
