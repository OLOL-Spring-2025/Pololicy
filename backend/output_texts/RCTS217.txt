PURPOSE:  To define the standards for intermittent visualization of the high risk patient as an 
adjunct to nursing care. 
POLICY:  Those patients who, in the assessment of the registered nurse, could benefit from 
an increased level of visualization / monitoring may be placed in a room where 
video monitoring is available.  This monitoring is intermittent rather than 
continuous and is not to imply constant surveillance.  All measures to protect the 
dignity and privacy of the patient will be maintained. 
PROCEDURE:  
1. Explain rationale for video monitoring to patient and / or family. 
2. Communication must be made to the care team indicating the patient is undergoing intermittent 
visualization / monitoring. 
3. Monitoring may be discontinued at patient / family request or as needed to protect the dignity 
and privacy of the patient.
