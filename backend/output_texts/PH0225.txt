Medications: Zoledronic Acid Policy Reference #:  PH-02-25 
Supersedes#:  NA 
Review Date: 6/3/24 
Date of Origination: January 2020 
Revision Date:  04/15/2020 
 
Purpose: 
To allow pharmacists to provide for zoledronic acid renal dosing when used for oncology-related 
indications in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. 
 
Definitions: 
1. Creatinine: A breakdown product of the important nitrogenous metabolic substance 
creatinine. Creatinine is a normal metabolic waste substance and is found in muscle and 
blood and excreted in the urine. 
2. Serum Creatinine (SCr): Creatinine found in the serum 
3. Creatinine Clearance (CrCl): The ratio of the rate of creatinine excretion in urine to its 
concentration in serum, a value that reflects the body's ability to excrete creatinine; it is 
used to diagnose and monitor renal function 
 
Cockcroft and Gault equation: 
CrCl = [(140 - age) x weight] / (Scr x 72) (x 0.85 for females) 
 
Prescribing: 
1. A serum creatinine measurement should be obtained within 7–10 days before the first 
infusion of zoledronic acid. 
2. A serum creatinine measurement should be obtained prior to each subsequent dose of 
Zoledronic Acid. 
3. Creatinine clearance should be estimated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula.  
The appropriate zoledronic acid dose is recommended below. 
The dosing interval is not affected by renal function. 
 
 
Baseline CrCl (ml/min)  Dose of Zoledronic Acid  
> 60  4mg  
50 – 60  3.5mg  
40 – 49  3.3mg  
30 - 39  3.0mg  
< 30  Not recommended 
 
 
 
Dispensing: 
1. If no serum creatinine has been ordered within 7 days prior, pharmacy may order a one-
time serum creatinine.  This applies for all oncology-related zoledronic acid orders.  
2. Pharmacy will verify the appropriateness and dosing of zoledronic acid for patient’s renal 
function based on table below for the following oncology-related indications: 
 
1. Bone metastases from solid tumors 
2. Multiple myeloma 
3. Prostate cancer - Prevention of bone loss associated with androgen deprivation 
therapy 
4. Breast cancer 
▪ Prevention of bone loss associated with aromatase inhibitor therapy 
▪ Adjuvant therapy 
 
3. If the the dose of zolendronic acid should be modified based on the CrCl chart below, 
pharmacy may adjust dose per protocol in Epic and document the change.  This applies 
only to the indications listed above. 
 
 
Baseline CrCl (ml/min)  Dose of Zoledronic Acid  
> 60  4mg  
50 – 60  3.5mg  
40 – 49  3.3mg  
30 - 39  3.0mg  
< 30  Not recommended – contact 
prescriber 
 
 
4. Zoledronic acid use for hypercalcemia  
a. May obtain a serum creatinine if one has not been ordered within 7 days prior 
b. Will NOT be adjusted per this protocol (see Lexi-Comp for recommendations) 
c. If the patient has one of the indications above but is receiving zoledronic acid for 
hypercalcemia, do not adjust per this policy and see Lexi-Comp for dosing 
adjustment in hypercalcemia recommendations
