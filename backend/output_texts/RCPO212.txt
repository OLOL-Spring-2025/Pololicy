PURPOSE:  To establish The Rehabilitation Center’s position on offering patients the opportunity to 
perform certain hospital tasks during their rehabilitation process. 
 
POLICY:  While recognizing that work therapy for some patients is appropriate for their plan of 
care and that said patients have the right to perform or refuse tasks in or for the hospital if 
offered, given the fact that The Rehabilitation Center is an Acute Inpatient facility and 
that the average length of stay is between 14&16 days, it is the policy of The 
Rehabilitation Center not to offer patients the opportunity to perform work in or for the 
organization, but rather design appropriate therapy treatments to meet patients needs.
