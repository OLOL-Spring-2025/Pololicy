PURPOSE:   
To define the coordination and the responsibilities of the personnel in multiple departments involved in 
implementing the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) – ADULT and PEDIATRIC 
 
POLICY: 
In trauma situations, when the attending Physician/Surgeon deems it necessary to facilitate emergency 
blood volume replacement, the transfusion team will be notified to institute the Massive Transfusion 
Protocol (MTP).   
 
A. MTP will remain in effect until canceled by the attending Physician/Surgeon.   
B. Blood identification bands will be placed on the ankle instead of the forearm to facilitate access. 
C. It is the responsibility of the attending ECU Physician or Trauma Surgeon to determine the timing  
     and necessity for Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) activation and termination.

PROTOCOL / PROCEDURE FOR ADULT PATIENTS 
A. Indications for Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) 
1. Massive blood loss with shock: 
Adult  
ABC Score of  ≥ 2 
o Penetrating mechanism (yes = 1, no = 0) 
o ED SBP of 90 mmHg or less (yes = 1, no = 0) 
o ED HR of 120 bpm or greater (yes = 1, no = 0) 
o Positive FAST (yes = 1, no = 0) 
 
2. Continued active bleeding: 
• In this period the need to continue MTP will be reassessed by the treating physician and 
may be continued if there is likelihood that substantial blood loss will continue short term.

1.    MTP physician’s verbal order is first called directly to Transfusion Services 765-8891,    
bypassing the electronic medical record system.  
Caller provides the Blood Bank Technologist with the following: 
• Identification (MR/Trauma #) 
• Patient’s weight in kg  
• Gender 
• Ordering physician’s name 
• Location to which blood products are to be delivered 
• Contact number for ongoing communication between departments.  
 
2. Transfusion Services calls PBX Operator at 765-3333 to initiate Code Transfusion Process. 
3. The PBX operator overhead pages “Code Transfusion Team” and states the location.  
NOTE:  “Code Transfusion Team” consists of staff members who will be assigned to report 
to Transfusion Services to assist in the transportation of blood components to the patient. If 
additional courier assistance is needed, the Blood Bank will engage laboratory team 
members. 
4. The PBX operator calls the Patient Care Services house supervisor cell phone and also  
    pages the patient care services attendant to act as courier. 
5. If not done prior to the initiation of MTP, send patient blood samples to lab for STAT   
     Type & Match, CMP, CBC and Coagulation Panel (PT, PTT, Platelets & Fibrinogen). 
6. One nurse attending the patient is assigned as the MTP coordinator and a blood bank technologist 
is designated as the Blood Bank coordinator.  
        
  The nurse MTP Coordinator does the following:             
a. Update the Blood Bank coordinator if the patient is relocated. 
b. Monitor patient response to MTP and lab values relevant to protocol. 
c. Monitor and document blood product administration, keeping a running 
chronology. 
d. Order STAT coagulation panels with fibrinogen following administration of each 
batch. 
e.   Upon receipt of coag lab results, promptly communicates those results to the 
      physician, for consideration of MTP batch alteration.   
e. Maintain communication between lab team and bedside team regarding all aspects 
of MTP.   NBL-003 
Page 3 of 10 
f. Notify the Blood Bank @ 5-8891 immediately when MTP termination order is 
received. 
 g. Ensures immediate return of all unused MTP blood products to the Blood Bank. 
      
The Blood Bank MTP coordinator does the following: 
                a. Initiate immediate preparation and delivery of MTP blood component  
                     batch #1 to the patient’s location: 
                b. Maintain communication with nurse MTP coordinator  
                c. Continue releasing component batches until MTP is terminated  
                d. Notify PBX operator to overhead page “Cancel Code Transfusion.   
                e. Release transfusion team courier at termination of MTP.   
 
C. ADULT (Patient ≥ 50kg) MTP COMPONENT BATCHES   
▪ 6 units PRBC 
▪ 6 units of Thawed Plasma or FFP  
▪ 20 units of Cryoprecipitate (Cryo) 
▪ 1 Platelet, Apheresis 
 
D. Considerations for Providers 
1. CALCIUM REPLACEMENT- Consider in all adult patients  
a. Administer Calcium gluconate 1 gm IV Slow Push over 10 minutes 
b. Recommended to give 1 gm calcium gluconate for every 3 units FFP (i.e. Calcium 
Gluconate 2 gm per MTP batch) 
 
2. TRANEXAMIC ACID (TXA) AKA Cyklokapron 
a. Class and Indication: Antifibrinolytic used to treat coagulopathy 
b. Must be initiated early in the coagulopathic cascade (within first 3 hours following trauma) 
– treatment greater than 3 hours after injury associated with increased mortality 
c. Contraindications: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, active thromboembolism, disseminitated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
 
3. TXA ADULT  DOSING: (1g TXA vials are stocked in Trauma Bay 1 pyxis)  
a. Dilute 1g TXA each-- in two 100cc bags 0.9% NaCl                                                                                                                                                                               
b. Loading dose: 1 g TXA IVPB - administer immediately over 10 minutes. 
c. Follow immediately with infusion 1g TXA IVPB over 8 hours (12.5 ml/hr) 
 
   NBL-003 
Page 4 of 10 
4. CLOTTING FACTORS 
a. The use of 4-Factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (KcentraTM) in MTP needs further 
clinical trials to be supported by evidence. The American College of Surgeons recommends the 
use of PCC over Factor VIIa (Novoseven) for MTP. May consider in the setting of salvage 
therapy. 
b. Several studies in actively bleeding patients strongly suggest that efforts directed at reversing 
coagulopathy with factors are ineffective without first achieving adequate resuscitation (i.e. 
ineffective with temperature ≤ 35C, inadequate tissue perfusion, and acidemia [pH ≤7.2]) 
c. Contraindications: diseeminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia (contains heparin), or hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation 
including human albumin 
 
5. 4-FACTOR PROTHROMBIN COMPLEX CONTRATE (KcentraTM) DOSING:  
a. Must request from pharmacy at ext. 5-8002 or with pre-printed form in OR. 
i. Kcentra: 25 units/kg IVPB x1 dose (max dose: 2500 units) 
ii. Infuse at 0.12 ml/kg/hr. Do not exceed infusion rate of 8.4 ml/min 
iii. Do not repeat dose within 24 hours due to risk of thromboembolism 
 
E.  Systematic Oversight 
1. The Blood Bank Medical Director and the Blood Bank Compliance Committee will initially 
review all occurrences where the MTP has been utilized, and further evaluations may occur at the 
quarterly meeting of the Blood Utilization Committee, verifying that turnaround times and action 
thresholds were properly followed.  
2. The Blood Bank Medical Director will serve as the contact person for the trauma team when 
service issues arise.
