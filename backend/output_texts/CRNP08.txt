Formulated By:               Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation, Cardiology Services   
 
Purpose: 
 
To establish and provide for a basic structure for education patients and families about a procedure or chronic 
physical condition so that each may more fully understand that procedure or condition, and the recovery 
process associated with each. 
 
Applies To:                      All Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Staff 
 
Policy: 
 
Pre-operative and Discharge instruction concerning cardiac procedures or chronic cardiac conditions will be 
available for patients and families upon request or physician's order. Outlines/ teaching plans are available in 
the Inpatient Education Manual. Procedures and conditions included for inpatient education provided by 
Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation are: 
 Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Pacemaker 
 Heart Valve Repair/ Replacement Electrophysiology Studies (EPS) 
 Cardiac Catheterization Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) 
 PTCA Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) 
 Coronary Stent Coumadin therapy 
 Myocardial Infarction (MI)/ Cardiac Risk Factors 
 
Although basic cardiac nutritional education may be a part of some education procedures provided by 
Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation, more extensive nutritional and diet therapy will be provided for appropriate 
patients, such as Coronary Artery Bypass or Myocardial Infarction, by Dieticians or assistants from Clinical 
Nutritional Services. 
 
 
Procedure: 
 
When appropriate, pre-operative education for cardiac procedures is available when ordered by a physician.  
 
For procedures that may involve a fairly short time as a hospital patient, pre -operative and discharge 
information may be conveyed at the same time. Such procedures may include Cardiac Catheterization, PTCA, 
Coronary Stent, Pacemaker, EPS, or ICD.  
 
Separate pre-operative and discharge instructions may occur for procedures that necessitate a longer hospital 
stay, such as Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery, and Heart Valve Repair/ Replacement.   
 
Education for cardiac events or chronic conditions, such as Myocardial Infarction or Congestive Heart Failure, 
will be presented at a time during the hospital stay when the patient and/ or family will be most receptive.   
All teaching procedures available from Cardiac Rehabilitation are outlined in the Inpatient Teaching Manual. 
Manuals are located in the Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation offices and a copy has been distributed to each 
Cardiology Telemetry unit.
