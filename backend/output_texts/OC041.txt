evidence-based guidelines when and where applicable.

including performance improvement department representatives.  Participants in the development may 
include all areas referenced in the clinical practice guideline.  Development of organization -wide 
diagnosis or process -driven guidelines is preferred.  Criteria used to develop clinical practice guidelines 
include, but are not limited to, current published practice guidelines, patient outcomes data, and high 
frequency/problem prone diagnoses or procedures.

The clinical practice guidelines/protocols will be reviewed by the Medical Executive Committee for final 
endorsement. 
3. Deployment:

available for use through the electronic medical record (EMR) in the patientâ€™s chart, menu/order/search of 
the Clinical Practice guideline/protocol to initiate.   Clinical practice guidelines will also be available for 
use via structured implementation of computerized physician order entry (CPOE).  When a Clinical 
Practice Guideline/Protocol is implemented, a MD order will be entered into EMR.
