SUBJECT:    
Standard Operating Process 
Surgical Skin Antisepsis (Surgical Prep) 
 
 
PAGE 1 OF 5 
 
 
 
Purpose 
 To provide guidelines and instructions for surgical skin preparation 
Policy 
 Surgical skin preparation will be done according to AORN Guidelines and manufacturer 
recommendations/instructions to reduce resident and transient microbial counts at the surgical site thus 
reducing the risk of SSI’s and to prevent injury to the patient. 
 
Procedure Interventions 
• Preoperative patient bathing and skin antisepsis products will be approved by a product selection 
committee; only bathing and skin antisepsis products approved and provided by the health care 
organization will be used.  
• Preoperative patient bathing and skin antisepsis products will be approved by a product selection 
committee; only bathing and skin antisepsis products approved and provided by the health care 
organization will be used.  
• The perioperative team shall be aware of the product manufacturer’s instructions for use and 
contraindications. 
1.  Hair Removal 
• The patient will be instructed to leave hair in place at the surgical site before surgery. 
• Leave hair at the surgical site in place when feasible. 
• If hair removal is necessary, remove hair at the surgical site by clipping in a manner that 
minimizes injury to the skin. 
• Stroke the clipper head against the direction that the hair is growing using short strokes. Hair 
stubble will still be evident after clipping. 
▪ Remove hair in a private location (e.g., preoperative room or bay) before entering 
the operating or procedure room. 
▪ When unable to remove hair before entering the operating or procedure room for 
reasons of pt. anxiety or privacy, remove the patient’s hair in a manner that prevents 
hair dispersal into the air. Contain the hair on disposable pads and utilize tape or 
suction to catch loose hair. 
▪ Use only single-use clipper heads and dispose after each patient use. 
▪ Disinfect reusable clipper handles after each use, in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions for use. 
▪ The use of razors is not recommended. 
2.  Basic Steps for All Types of Skin Preps

04/12/2018 MMS 
• A safe, effective, facility-approved preoperative antiseptic will be selected for the individual patient 
based on patient assessment and the procedure type  
• The perioperative RN will assess: 
➢ allergies and sensitivities to preoperative skin antiseptics 
➢ skin integrity at the surgical site 
➢ Surgical site for the presence of hair. 
• The perioperative RN will consult the physician when there are contraindications against using the 
selected prep solution.  The perioperative team members will collaboratively evaluate the risks and 
benefits of using an alternative antiseptic product when facility-approved antiseptic products are 
contraindicated for the individual patient. 
• Expose only the area to be prepped to ensure privacy and warmth of 
the patient 
• Perioperative team members will confirm the surgical site and physician marking before performing 
patient skin antisepsis. 
• The perioperative RN will prepare the skin for antisepsis. 
➢ Wash skin at the surgical site with a facility-approved product or soap if the patient 
did not have the preoperative bath or shower, or when soil, debris, emollients, or 
cosmetics are present, or when a cast or splint has been removed at the surgical site. 
• A non-scrubbed perioperative team member will apply the skin antiseptic using sterile technique and 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use. 
• Wear surgical attire that covers the arms while performing skin antisepsis. 
• Perform hand hygiene and wear sterile gloves. 
• Nonsterile gloves may be worn if the antiseptic applicator is of sufficient length to prevent contact of 
the gloved hand with the antiseptic solution and the patient’s skin. 
• Use sterile supplies to apply the antiseptic. 
• Apply the antiseptic to an area large enough to accommodate potential shifting of the surgical 
drapes, extension of the incision (e.g., during conversion of a minimally invasive procedure to an 
open procedure), potential additional incisions, and all potential drain sites. 
• Apply the antiseptic starting at the incision site and moving toward the periphery of the surgical site. 
➢ For an incision site that is more contaminated than the surrounding skin (e.g., perineum), prep 
the area with lower bacterial count first, followed by the area of higher contamination, as 
opposed to working from the incision toward the periphery. 
• Discard the applicator after contact with a peripheral or contaminated area. Use another sterile 
applicator for additional antiseptic applications. 
• Do not “back track” over an area that has already been prepped with the same 
prep sponge, nor “double dip” back into the prep solution.  
• Apply the antiseptic with care on fragile tissue, burns, open wounds, or malignant areas. 
• Cover all surfaces of the skin in the surgical field, especially areas between fingers or toes. 
• Take protective measures to prevent prolonged contact with skin antiseptics. 
➢ Protect sheets, padding, positioning equipment, creases and folds from dripping or pooling of the 
skin antiseptic on, beneath and around the patient. 
➢ Protect electrodes (e.g., electrocardiogram, electrosurgical unit dispersive electrode) and 
tourniquets from contact with the skin antiseptic. 
➢ For the patient in lithotomy position, place a fluid-resistant pad under the patient’s buttocks 
during skin antisepsis. 
• Do not blot or wipe off prepping solution. Allow the antiseptic to dry for the full time 
recommended in the manufacturer’s instructions for use before sterile drapes are applied.  
• Take protective measures to minimize the risk of fire when flammable antiseptics are used. 
➢ Communicate use of flammable antiseptics as part of the fire risk assessment involving the entire 
perioperative team before beginning the surgical procedure. 
• Prevent antiseptics from pooling or soaking into linens or the patient’s hair by: 
➢ reusable or disposable sterile towels to absorb drips and excess solution during application  
Page 3 of 5 
04/12/2018 MMS 
➢ removal of materials that are saturated with the skin antiseptic before the patient is draped 
➢ wicking of excess solution with a sterile towel to help dry the surgical prep area completely. 
• Allow time for the antiseptic to dry completely and for any fumes to dissipate before surgical drapes 
are applied or a potential ignition source is used. 
• Do not heat flammable skin antiseptics. 
• Remove flammable prep solutions and their containers from the room before the beginning of the 
procedure.   
• The surgical site mark should remain visible after preoperative patient skin antisepsis 
• The use of flammable prep solutions is part of the fire risk assessment which is communicated 
during the “Time Out”.  
• At the end of the surgical procedure, remove the skin antiseptic from the patient’s skin before application 
of an occlusive dressing or tape unless otherwise indicated by the manufacturer’s instructions for use. 
• The perioperative RN will assess the patient’s skin for injury after surgery. 
• All personnel will review and follow the skin antiseptic manufacturer’s instructions for use and safety 
data sheets for handling, storing, and disposing of skin antiseptics. 
➢ Store skin antiseptics in the original, single-use container and discard skin antiseptics in single-use 
containers after use  
➢ Do not dilute skin antiseptics after opening 
➢ Nonflammable skin antiseptics will only be heated if in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions for use. (CHG wipes) 
 
3. Prepping Contaminated Areas 
• If the patient did not bathe or shower preoperatively, the perioperative team member should have the 
patient use CHG wipes in the pre op area and wash the skin again at the surgical site with CHG 
wipes before performing preoperative skin antisepsis when a cast or splint is removed. 
• Clean areas of greater contamination with gross debris within the surgical field (e.g., umbilicus, 
foreskin, under nails, intestinal or urinary stoma) before starting skin antisepsis prep. 
• Isolate highly contaminated areas (e.g., anus, colostomy) that are near the surgical site with a sterile 
barrier drape. 
• Prep the most contaminated area last using separate sponges. 
• Sponges used to prep open wounds, sinuses, ulcers, intestinal stomas, the vagina or anus should be 
used once and then discarded. 
• Peripheral intact skin is prepped before open wounds and body orifices. 
• Retract foreskin if prep involves the penis; pull foreskin back once prep is completed to prevent 
compromise to circulation. 
• When performing a surgical skin prep for necrotizing fasciitis: 
➢ if skin is intact performed as usual, however treat intact skin carefully due 
   to loss of structure under the skin; or 
➢ if skin is broken, consider the open area to be contaminated and prep 
  the open area with a separate sponge after prepping the surrounding areas first. 
 
Recommended Application of Skin Prep Agents (refer to manufacturer’s instructions for 
use and drying times): 
4. Betadine Scrub and Paint Surgical Skin Prep:  
•  Perform applicable steps as per section 2: Basic Steps and 3.; Prepping contaminated areas 
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for use for strength and dilution 
• Don sterile gloves. 
•  Tuck drip towels under patient as necessary to prevent pooling of solution, protect electrodes.  
Page 4 of 5 
04/12/2018 MMS 
• Mechanically and chemically cleanse the skin in a linear and circular motion as 
 per skin antiseptic manufacturers’ instructions. 
• Blot cleansed area dry with a sterile towel as follows: 
➢ Open a towel fully and place it over the site; and 
➢ Lift carefully without rubbing or dragging the contaminated fabric edges 
over the cleaned area. 
• Perform the solution paint: utilizing the same basic steps; mechanically and chemically cleanse the 
skin in a linear and circular motion as per skin antiseptic manufacturers’ instructions. 
➢ Remove drip towels by grasping the edges in a manner to prevent the towel edges 
from contaminating the prepped skin 
➢ Allow prepping solution to air dry PRIOR to draping. 
 
5. Chloroprep® Packaged Single Unit Applicator 
• Perform applicable steps as per section 2: Basic Steps. And 3: Prepping contaminated areas 
•  Don sterile gloves unless the applicator is of sufficient length to prevent the 
 antiseptic and patient’s skin from contact with the nonsterile glove. (AORN: 2009) 
• Tuck drip towels under patient as necessary to prevent pooling of solution: 
• Follow manufacturers’ instructions for use of prep applicator, solution, and activation 
• Do not blot or wipe off prepping solution. Allow prepping solution to air 
 dry PRIOR to draping, a minimum of 3 minutes.  
• Remove drip towels by grasping the edges in a manner to prevent the towel edges from 
contaminating prepped skin.  
 
1. Hibiclens 
• Use a sterile betadine prep tray and remove the betadine scrub and paint solutions.  
• Pour Hibiclens in the tray receptacle. Do not dilute with saline, H2O or alcohol. 
• Apply solution with sponges using a back-and-forth motion at the incision site to periphery for 2 
minutes, blot dry, then repeat for an additional 2 minutes and blot dry again.  
• Do not apply saline, H2O or alcohol following the prep.  
• Hibiclens is not recommended for use on mucus membranes, inner ear, eyes, lumbar punctures, in 
the proximity of the meninges and very young infant
