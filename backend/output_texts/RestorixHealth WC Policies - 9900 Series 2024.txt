PURPOSE 
The purpose of non-invasive vascular studies (NIVS) is to screen for peripheral artery disease (PAD). This is the 
recommended first step in RestorixHealth 7-Steps of Wound Management Process when a patient presents with a 
lower extremity wound. The results will assist in determining if further investigation or treatment is required.  
NIVS are a group of procedures including but not limited to ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), 
pulse volume recording (PVR), or skin perfusion pressure (SPP).  
POLICY 
• A NIVS will be performed and documented for all new patients with lower extremity ulcers, gangrene, or 
symptoms of PAD (i.e. intermittent claudication), by the 1st or second visit to the center. Refer to EMR 
Connection on SharePoint for details on proper documentation of test results.  
• P atients with ulcer(s) that have not had measurable improvement (50% area and/or volume reduction within 
30 days of treatment) a NIVS will be considered on the 30-day re-evaluation.  
• The ABI will only be used as ordered by a provider and by following guidelines as outlined in the ABI 
equipment Operating Manual or policy 904B for manual tests. Patient safety, comfort, HIPAA guidelines, and 
infection control practices will be considered during the procedure and the results will be interpreted by 
informed providers. 
• The Center Leader or designee is to ensure competency documentation is completed and filed in personnel  
file for the employee performing the test. 
• In accordance with local coverage determinations and numerous professional society guidelines, palpable 
pulses are no longer acceptable as the sole indicator of determining vascular flow. 
• Inquire about recent use of tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, recent heavy activity, and the presence of pain. When 
possible, advise patients to avoid stimulants or heavy activity for an hour prior to the test. 
INDICATIONS 
• Evaluation of perfusion in any patient with a lower extremity wound:  
o Determine adequate arterial blood flow in lower extremities prior to wound debridement, placement of 
bioengineered tissue, or application of compression therapy (check local coverage determination for local 
requirements) 
o Aid in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia (CLI)  
o A ssess wound healing potential  
• Intermittent claudication 
• Over 50 years of age with a history of tobacco use or diabetes mellitus. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS 
• Use caution with ABI in suspected deep vein thrombosis (redness, swelling, very warm and/or pain), as this 
could lead to dislodgement of the thrombosis. 
• Use caution with applying cuffs over fresh surgical incisions.

• ABI is contraindicated with severe pain (unable to tolerate procedure) associated with lower extremity 
wound(s) 
• Do not take blood pressure in the arm of the affected side post-mastectomy or on the arm with a dialysis 
fistula.  
PROCEDURE  
1. Obtain the order from the provider and explain the procedure to the patient.  
2. Prepare and position the patient for the testing procedure, providing privacy.  
3. Follow infection control guidelines, using cuff liners/extremity sleeves or other barriers as indicated.  
4. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for ensuring the proper location and positioning of the device.  
5. The ABI is performed with a computerized device or manually with a Doppler and cuff. For directions on how 
to perform a manual ABI, see policy #9904B. 
6. Stop the procedure if the patient complains of pain or any other symptoms during the testing.  
7. When testing is complete, provide the patient information and test results to the provider.  
8. The patient should be referred to the vascular specialist within 7 days for any abnormal result (ABI >1.1 or 
less than 0.7).  
9. Clean the equipment in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines.  
10. Capture test results; scan or document into WoundDocs or the EMR per policy.  
INTERPRETATION  
ABI results can be interpreted as:  
• >1.1 – elevated*  
• 0.9 – 1.1 – normal*  
• 0.7 – 0.9 – mild PAD  
• 0.4-0.7 – moderate PAD  
• <0.4 – severe PAD  
Note: 
• Specific testing devices may recommend slightly different parameters, ultimately treatment interpretations of 
testing results and treatment plans are at the discretion of the treating provider. 
• C alcification of vessels from diabetes may lead to inaccurate results.

PURPOSE 
The purpose of an ABI (ankle brachial index) is to screen for peripheral artery disease (PAD) by providing an 
objective indicator of arterial perfusion to a lower extremity 1-4. 
The ABI is a simple, non-invasive tool used to screen PAD. This test establishes an index of macro-circulatory 
perfusion to the lower extremity.  It must be interpreted with caution in patients with diabetes since it can be falsely 
elevated or falsely negative.  
POLICY 
Review Policy 9904A Non-Invasive Vascular Studies for indications, contraindications, etc. prior to performing an 
ABI. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS 
• The use of pulse palpation or single limb automated blood pressure cuffs to measure blood pressures for the 
ABI are not considered reliable. 
• Inquire about recent use of tobacco, caffeine, or alcohol, recent heavy activity, and presence of pain. When 
possible, advise patients to avoid stimulants or heavy activity for an hour prior to the test. 
• Do not take blood pressure in the arm of the affected side post-mastectomy or on the arm with a dialysis 
fistula. 
PROCEDURE   
1. If using automated ABI equipment, follow the manufacturer's instructions for testing. If testing errors occur, 
consider a manual evaluation, as outlined below. 
2. Measure Brachial Pressures with Doppler (manual process) 
A. Perform the ABI results in a quiet, warm environment.  Ensure the patient is relaxed, comfortable, and 
has an empty bladder. 
B. Place the patient in a flat, supine position for at least 10 minutes before the test. Palpate the brachial 
pulse to determine the location to obtain an audible pulse. 
C. Apply transmission gel over the pulse site. 
D. Place the tip of the Doppler probe at a 45° angle pointed towards the patient’s head until an audible pulse 
signal is obtained. 
E. Inflate the pressure cuff 20-30 mmHg above the point where the pulse is no longer audible. (If the pulse 
remains audible, this is an indication that the patient is non-compressible and vascular testing may be 
warranted.

A. Place the cuff on the patient’s lower leg with the bottom of the cuff approximately 2-3 cm above the 
malleolus. 
B. Prior to placing the cuff, apply a protective barrier if a wound is present. 
C. Measure both dorsalis pedis (top of the foot, usually between first and second metatarsal) and posterior 
tibial (Medial ankle, posterior to the medial malleolus bone) pulses in each leg, using palpation or 
Doppler. 
D. Apply transmission gel over the pulse site. 
E. Place the tip of the Doppler probe at a 45° angle pointed towards the patient’s knee until an audible pulse 
signal is obtained. 
1) Inflate the pressure cuff 20-30 mmHg above the point where the pulse is no longer audible.  (If the 
pulse remains audible, this is an indication that the patient is non-compressible, and vascular testing 
may be warranted. 
F. Deflate the pressure cuff at a rate of 2-3 mmHg per second, noting the manometer reading at which the 
first pulse signal is heard and record that systolic value. 
G. Repeat the procedure to measure the pressure on the other ankle. 
H. Use the higher of the right or left ankle pressures to calculate the ABI for both legs. 
4. Document all pressures in the Lower Extremity Assessment form. 
5. Provide calculation results to the patient’s provider.  
6. Follow the provider’s orders regarding action to be taken on ABI results. 
7. If using automated ABI equipment, scan wave form into test results. 
8. Document results as discrete data in test results.  See policy #9928.If unable to complete within the center, in 
a reasonable timeframe, refer the patient for vascular testing. 
INTERPRETATION  
ABI results can be interpreted as:  
• >1.1 – elevated*  
• 0.9 – 1.1 – normal*  
• 0.7 – 0.9 – mild PAD  
• 0.4 – 0.7 – moderate PAD  
• <0.4 – severe PAD  
Note: 
• Although specific testing devices may recommend slightly different parameters, ultimately, treatment 
interpretations of testing results and treatment plans are at the discretion of the treating provider. 
• C alcification of vessels from diabetes may lead to inaccurate results.

PURPOSE 
To provide guidance for clinicians on the methodology and components in completing a Lower Extremity 
Assessment (LEA). 
A foot evaluation allows for a neuropathic assessment as needed in diabetic patients. 
POLICY  
• At initial visit, readmission visit, or upon the development of a new lower extremity (LE) wound, complete a 
bilateral Lower Extremity Assessment that includes all three sections of the assessment screen in the EMR: 
Edema/Measurements, Vascular, and Offloading. Follow the situation table below to identify current 
performance guidelines. Document results as required within the electronic medical record (EMR) . 
 
# Situation table Edema Measurements Vascular Offloading Both 
Extremities 
1 LEA-Initial / readmit / new LE 
wound (if edema present) 
x x x x x 
2 LEA- Initial / readmit / new LE 
wound (if edema not present) 
x NA x x x 
3 LEA-each subsequent visit with no 
edema or no compression 
x NA x x Effected 
leg only 
4 LEA-each subsequent visit with 
edema and/or compression  
x x x x Effected 
leg(s) only 
 
• Based on patient presentation, foot Evaluation (neuropathic evaluation) is performed as needed.  
• The completed Lower Extremity Assessment will serve as an addendum to the provider's history and physical.  
• Compression therapy should not be initiated until vascular screening is completed. An ABI must be completed 
prior to the application of compression per manufacturers and payors. Compression therapy may be 
contraindicated with congestive heart failure.  Check manufacturer instructions for a comprehensive list of 
product-specific contraindications. 
• Patients with a complaint(s) of severe foot pain or signs of ischemia should have a complete vascular 
assessment/reassessment, including an ABI, and be referred immediately for further vascular evaluation.  
• If a wound is not progressing a vascular (ABI, SPP, etc.) re-evaluation should be considered during the 30-
day visit.  
• The presence of pedal or post-tibial Doppler pulses is insufficient as a sole assessment of vascular status and 
adequacy of arterial blood flow. 
PROCEDURE – LOWER EXTREMITY ASSESSMENT 
1. Position the patient in a comfortable, reclining position (if possible) to make examining legs, feet, and toes 
easier. If the patient can tolerate supine throughout the assessment, this will prepare them for the Non-
Invasive Vascular Assessment (ABI, SPP).

2. Remove shoes or footwear from both lower extremities.  
3. Perform assessment per patient need on the Lower Extremity Assessment screen. Document in the following 
sections as needed:  Edema Assessment, Vascular Assessment and Offloading. 
EDEMA ASSESSMENT SECTION 
1. Edema inhibits wound edge approximation and interferes with wound closure. Assessment and treatment of 
edema are key to obtaining wound closure.  Compression therapy is recommended to treat signs of edema.  
2. Measurement of Edema - if edema is present, circumferences are measured initially and subsequently 
according to the situation table on previous page.  
A. Instep of Foot - measure from the back of the heel to the midfoot to get the 
measurement as close to the proximal border of the metatarsals as possible.  
B. Ankle - measure 5 centimeters from the center of the medial malleolus.  
C. Calf - measure from the base of the heel to the widest part of the calf. 
 
 
NOTE: When documenting in the EMR, measurements should be from a consistent location each week. It is 
recommended that you review the lower extremity assessment prior to measuring to establish the correct points 
of measurement. 
3. Quality of Edema – Assess whether edema is pitting or non-pitting. 
A. Pitting Edema:  Observable swelling of body tissues due to fluid accumulation that may be 
demonstrated by applying pressure to the edematous area (such as by depressing the skin with a 
finger). If the pressing causes an indentation that persists after the release of the pressure, the edema is 
referred to as pitting edema.  
1) 1+ is 2mm depression, barely detectable, immediate rebound.  
2) 2+ is 4mm deep pit, 10-15 seconds to rebound.  
3) 3+ is 6mm deep pit, up to a minute to rebound. 
4) 4+ is 8mm: very deep pit, 2-5 minutes to rebound.

B. Non-Pitting:  This is the type of edema in which the indentation made by a pressure on the affected area 
does not persist. It is often associated with lymphedema, lipedema, and myxedema.  
VASCULAR ASSESSMENT SECTION 
1. Assessment of Pulses: 
A. Palpate the popliteal pulse: The back of the knee. 
B. Palpate the posterior tibial pulse: The posterior tibial artery is usually located on the medial aspect of the 
ankle, posterior to the malleolus.  
C. Palpate the dorsalis pedis pulse: The dorsalis pedis artery is usually located on the dorsum of the foot 
between the first and second tarsal bones. 
NOTE: The Blood Pressure section can be used to document ABI. Other documentation points are not 
routinely required. 
2. Extremity colors, hair growth, and condition (skin condition):  
A. Hair growth on extremities:  Assess visible hair growth on the legs/feet/toes. It is important to ask female 
patients if they use some form of hair removal on their legs. The absence of hair growth may indicate 
micro vascular insufficiency, which may be associated with arterial or venous disease. 
3. Temperature of extremity:  Feel the lower extremities to assess skin temperature at different levels to 
determine if cold, cool, hot, or warm. Areas to be assessed are: 
A. Toes  
B. Feet  
C. Leg  
4. Capillary refill:  Apply adequate pressure to the nail bed, plantar surface of the toe, or the sole of the foot, to 
initiate loss of normal color. Once this pressure is removed the amount of time in seconds required for tissue 
to return to its original color must be noted. Normal capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds  (<3). Capillary 
refill greater than 3 seconds (>3) is considered abnormal. 
5. Erythema: Assess for redness 
6. Dependent rubor:  Assess for the presence of a noticeable redness or blueness of the skin around the feet 
and toes when the patient's legs are hanging in a dependent position.  This is a condition which could indicate 
arterial disease. 
7. Hyperpigmentation: Assess for darkening of the skin caused by hemosiderin (hemoglobin) deposition 
occurring just under the skin due to leaking from capillaries caused by such factors as venous hypertension, 
cardiovascular disease, and vein insufficiency. 
8. Lipodermatosclerosis: Visualize and palpate for fibrosis (nodules in the subcutaneous layers) and skin 
induration (raised smooth, shiny areas that are thicker/firmer than surrounding skin) typically within the gaiter 
area of the leg.  These characteristics are common in people with venous insufficiency. 
OFFLOADING EVALUATION SECTION 
• When a wound is located on the foot and/or over bony prominence on the lower extremity, offloading is 
required. Document whether an offloading device is in place, the type of device used, and ask the patient 
about proper use.  Record patient response and clinical observations, then provide patient education. 
• If offloading is not required due to etiology or location, document this within the notes section.

FOOT EVALUATION FORM  
• Evaluate for Neuropathy. There are several different methods available. Two of these can be performed at the 
bedside. They are the Ipswich Touch test and the Semmes Weinstein monofilament. 
o The Ipswich is a valid exam for neuropathy which is faster and simpler than the traditional Semmes -
Weinstein. 
o The Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test is performed using a 10-gram (5.07) Semmes Weinstein 
monofilament. 
Note:  A baseline foot x-ray should be considered where anatomical abnormalities are present. 
1. When performing the Ipswich Touch Test, instruct the patient to close their eyes and keep them closed for the 
duration of the test.  
A. Lightly rest the finger on each of the patient’s first, third, and fifth toes for 1 to 2 seconds (see picture 
below). Patients are instructed to respond with a “yes” when they feel the examiner’s touch.  
B. A “yes” response would be noted as +, a “no” response would be - . 
 
2. When performing the Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test, instruct the patient to close their eyes and keep 
them closed for the duration of the test. 
A. A practice test must be performed on the back of the patient's hand to prepare them for the sensation 
they can expect to feel on their feet.  
B. Do not ask the patient if they feel when you apply the filament as that will be suggestive to the patient 
and result in an inaccurate assessment.  
C. Apply the tip of the monofilament perpendicular to the skin with enough force to buckle / bend the nylon 
filament into a C shape, then withdraw it immediately. In the event there is a callus at a designated site, 
apply the monofilament adjacent to the callus.  
D. Advise the patient to indicate when they feel the filament being applied by saying “yes” each time they 
feel the filament applied.  
3. Follow the documentation instructions in the EMR (screen shot below). Repeat this process for both feet 
using pertinent assessment types below:

A. U se plus sign to indicate positive sensation. 
B. U se negative dash to indicate lack of sensation. 
C. C allus:  Presents as a painless thickening of the epidermis over bony prominences receiving excessive 
external pressure or friction. Often indicates poor fitting shoes, barefoot or sock foot walking or repeated 
trauma. 
D. U lcer:  Indicate location of ulcer 
E. R edness:  Indicate areas of redness  
F. W armth:  Indicate areas of warmth 
G. M aceration:  Excessive moisture from any source causing epithelial overhydration which increases the 
skin’s permeability and compromises barrier function. 
H. P re-ulcerative Lesion:  Indicate any areas of concern. 
I. Fissure:  Crack-like grooves in the epidermis, frequently located between the toes or at the base of the 
heel and are typically an indication of excessive skin moisture or dryness. 
J. S welling:  Indicate areas of swelling. 
K. D ryness:  The presence of epidermal exfoliation. Excessive dryness may indicate arterial disease. 
 
Note: The Risk Assessment and Footwear Recommendations section is not required but may be completed by 
the provider or scribed by the clinician. Referrals and/or plan of care should be documented within EMR.

PURPOSE 
A wound biopsy can be a useful tool to diagnose malignancy, malignant transformation, pyoderma gangrenosum, 
vasculitis, or other atypical wounds. 
POLICY 
• Biopsy all suspicious lesions. 
• Consider a biopsy for wounds greater than 90 days old. 
• Perform a biopsy or consider a repeat biopsy in wounds that have failed to respond to therapy in a reasonable 
timeframe. 
INDICATIONS 
• Biopsies are indicated for suspicious lesions or ulcers that have failed to respond to standard therapy. A 
suspicious lesion could have an unusual appearance, a past medical history that corroborates a potential risk 
factor, located in an unusual (non-weight-bearing) area or have been present for more than 90 days. 
• Aid in the diagnosis of wounds suspected to be atypical. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS 
Use caution around vascular structures and on patients receiving anticoagulation medications. 
PROCEDURE 
1. Place the patient in a comfortable position. 
2. Assist the Provider with the biopsy. 
3. Choose a biopsy method (punch, incisional, excisional). 
4. Use an injectable local anesthesia if sensate. 
5. If a punch biopsy, take tissue from the center of the lesion and the edge. Biopsy any area in or around the 
wound that appears suspicious. 
6. Ensure hemostasis. 
7. Properly label the specimens, refer to a clock face to describe the location of the biopsy on the wound.  
8. If the biopsy is from intact skin, a suture may be indicated to assist in wound closure.

PURPOSE 
An essential part of weekly wound assessment is measuring the wound. It is important to use a consistent 
technique every time a measurement is taken. The most common type of measurement is linear measurement, 
also known as the clock method. In this technique, measurement is taken of the longest length, greatest width, 
and greatest depth of the wound, using the body as the face of an imaginary clock.  
POLICY 
• Document the longest length using the face of the clock over the wound bed, and then measure the greatest 
width. On the feet, the heels are always at 12 o’clock and the toes are always at 6 o’clock. Document all 
measurements in centimeters as L x W x D. Remember, sometimes length is smaller than width.  
• Digital photos should be taken with the head at 12 o’clock and the toes at 6 o’clock and images of patient 
wounds must never include any ePHI within the photo or the file name.  
• The measuring tape within a wound photo cannot contain the patient’s name, social security number, and 
name of the center providing the care or any other identifiable PHI (personal health information) data.  
• For identifying the patient within the photo, only the last four digits of the patient’s medical record number, the 
patient’s initials, date, wound # or non-patient specific identifier can be used without any reference to the 
hospital.   A notation of “post” (which denotes debridement) should be used for the post-debridement photo. 
• For Tissue Analytics, no identifiers are required; photos are uploaded directly into the application. 
PROCEDURE 
1. Follow standard precautions. 
2. Place the patient in a comfortable position and expose the wound area completely.  Note: Wound 
measurement is best done in the same position for each encounter.  
3. Measure and photograph all wounds. 
4. Multiple wounds in the same anatomical location should be handled in the following manner:  
A. Take a picture that spans over the entire area showing all open lesions when possible. 
B. Take photographs and measurements of all individually identifiable wounds. 
C. For wounds that cannot be individually distinguished (i.e. wounds occurring within 1 centimeter with no 
definitive epithelial bridge), clustering of wounds is permitted.  Take photographs and measurements that 
capture the entire cluster.  When recording procedures, it is necessary to communicate with the provider 
and document the appropriate percentage of the wound area debrided. 
5. Wound measurement is documented as length x width x depth. 
6. When measuring length, keep in mind that: 
A. The head is always at 12 o’clock. 
B. The toes are always at 6 o’clock. 
C. The ruler should be placed over the wound on the longest length using the clock face.  
7. When measuring width: 
A. Measure perpendicular to the length, using the widest width. 
B. Place a ruler over the widest aspect of the wound and measure from 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock.

8. When measuring the depth: 
A. Place a cotton tip applicator into the deepest part of the wound bed and mark on the applicator (using 
finger and thumb) at the skin level. 
B. Grasp the applicator by the wound margin and place it against the ruler. 
9. To measure undermining: 
A. Check for undermining at each “hour” of the clock. 
B. Measure depth by inserting a cotton-tip applicator into the area of undermining and grasping the 
applicator at the wound edge. Then measure against the ruler and document the measurement.  
C. Using ranges for undermining (for instance, undermining of 1.5 cm noted from 12 – 3 o’clock) tends to be 
less time-consuming than documenting undermining at each individual hour.  
10. To measure tunneling: 
A. Insert a cotton-tip applicator into the tunnel. Grasp the applicator at the wound edge (not the wound bed) 
and measure in centimeters.  
B. Document tunneling using the clock as a reference for the location as well.  
11. All measurements are recorded and documented in centimeters.

PURPOSE 
To promote continuity between staff practices of cleansing, dressing, and filling (packing) wounds. 
PROCEDURE - WOUND CLEANSING 
All wounds must be cleansed with a non-cytotoxic agent prior to taking photographs and measurements and 
following debridement procedures, as ordered by the provider. 
1. Wash hands. 
2. Gather wound cleanser, dressing supplies, clean, non-sterile gloves, a protective pad, gauze, and a trash 
container for old bandages. 
3. Don gloves and follow standard precautions. 
4. Place a protective pad beneath the area to be cleaned. 
5. Remove the old dressing, then remove gloves and put gloves and old dressing in the trash container. 
6. Wash hands and don clean gloves. 
7. Rinse the wound with a non-cytotoxic cleanser. 
8. Using a clean gauze pad moistened with cleanser, wipe the wound bed, changing gauze as needed.  Remove 
loose devitalized tissue and discard soiled gauze pads. 
9. Using a clean gauze pad, wipe 10-20 cm of periwound area (as able). 
PROCEDURE - WOUND DRESSING 
Wounds shall be dressed prior to leaving the center, which shall include primary, secondary, and/or tertiary layers 
according to provider order. 
1. Wash hands. 
2. Gather dressing supplies.   
3. Don clean gloves and follow standard precautions. 
4. Apply dressing layers according to provider order and manufacturer guidelines.  
5. Discard all open, unused supplies.  Centers do not have a license to distribute, and unused products  may not 
leave the center (open or unopened) or be saved for future use. 
6. Remove gloves and wash hands. 
PROCEDURE - WOUND FILLING (PACKING) 
Wounds with depth, undermining, a tract, or a tunnel may be dressed using filling/packing materials.  
1. Don gloves and follow standard precautions. 
2. Do not over-pack the wound, as this can cause ischemia if packed too tightly and can cause trauma to the 
wound during the packing process. 
3. Use packing material as directed by manufacturer’s recommendations and provider’s order. Pack or fluff filling 
lightly into the wound.

D. A complete list of the patient’s medications shall be communicated to the next provider when referring or 
transferring to another setting, practitioner or level of care.  
2. For multiuse products, label all medications, medication containers (e.g., syringes, medicine cups, basins), or 
other solutions on and off the sterile field and/or clean treatment area. Each hospital has a different approach 
to this procedure, so check to ensure the center is following the pharmacy procedure regarding multi -dose 
vials and tubes. 
3. Most hospitals now require that all materials used to treat the patient be locked in a secure location. Non-
impregnated dressings are not defined as medication and, therefore, do not need to be in a locked location. 
4. Refer to the “Do Not Use Abbreviation” list specific to your hospital requirements.  
5. The Program Director/Lead Nurse or designee shall identify and, at a minimum, annually review a list of look -
alike/sound-alike medications used in the hospital and take action to prevent errors involving the interchange 
of these medications.  
6. The center shall minimize the use of verbal and telephone medication orders. (TJC.MM04.01.01).  
7. Once a vial is punctured or a cap is removed, the manufacturer’s expiration date is no longer valid and a 
revised date (called the ‘beyond use date” in pharmaceutical terminology) needs to be determined and 
labeled according to hospital policy and/or The Joint Commission relabeling guidelines (MM. 03.01.01 EP 7).  
8. Storage and preparation of medications must be done in a designated clean area outside the patient 
treatment room using clean, gloved hands. Medications are transferred to a syringe or medicine cup and 
appropriately labeled with product name and strength. If transferring to a syringe or medicine cup and 
immediate use will not be taking place, the labeling must include product, strength, staff initials, date, and 
time. 
9. All medications prepared for single-dose use are to be discarded if they have entered a patient treatment 
room or are not utilized during that visit.

PURPOSE 
To obtain patient information about risks that may need to be considered when establishing the patient’s plan of 
care. 
POLICY 
• During initial and re-admit visit types, each patient is to be evaluated for pain, fall(s), nutrition, suicide, and 
abuse risk on admission, and findings will be documented in the electronic medical record (EMR) and utilized 
in the plan of care development.  
• At each subsequent visit the reassessment is driven by the answers on the arrival information screen in the 
EMR. Pain, fall(s), and abuse are all assessed for changes, and alerts are added in the EMR to notify the 
user of required follow-up and documentation.  
Note: Reassessment timeframes and treatment strategies should reflect a patient-centered approach and 
consider the patient’s current presentation, the providers’ clinical judgment, and the risks and benefits 
associated with each strategy. 
• For any procedure performed, pain shall be assessed pre- and post-treatment and documented as such in the 
EMR. 
• Patients who have risk scores that fall out of the normal range must have appropriate documentation of 
interventions to address the risk(s) in their plan of care.  
PROCEDURE 
Using assessments provided in the EMR, complete the pain, fall, nutrition, and abuse/suicide risk screens during 
the initial history and physical visit. On scored screening tools the total number of points for each screening 
determines the patient’s overall risk. 
1. If the patient’s initial pain assessment requires it, refer to a primary care provider (PCP) or pain management 
specialist.  
A. Following the initial pain assessments completed on the first visit, pain assessment should focus only on 
wound or procedural pain.  
B. All recommendations and/or referrals must be documented in the plan of care.  
C. All interventions to reduce or manage pain shall be documented within the EMR.  
2. If the patient is at risk for a fall, consider a fall prevention plan and a method to identify all at risk patients by 
using the same process used by the hospital partner. (i.e. falling leaves on patient room door or chart, 
stickers, etc.) 
A. Morse Fall scoring is as follows: 
1) No Risk = 0-24 points (good basic nursing care) 
2) Low to Moderate Risk = 25-45 points (implement standard fall prevention interventions such as the 
falling leaf, etc.) 
3) High Risk = > 45 points (implement high-risk fall prevention interventions) 
B. If the patient is at moderate or high-risk or is identified to be at high risk for any single assessment item, 
discuss with the provider and consider a referral to a nutrition professional for a complete nutritional 
assessment.

PURPOSE 
Providing a consistent, thorough onboarding and orientation experience is vital to engagement and retention and 
promotes a culture of safety and high-quality care.  This policy outlines the onboarding and orientation processes 
and ensures that competency of knowledge and skills is initially assessed and periodically reverified through 
demonstration of continued skills competency.  
POLICY 
• Each person joining the clinic team will be onboarded utilizing the role-specific Onboarding Pathway and 
Schedule available within the SharePoint Training and Development page.  Center and Regional leadership 
will collaborate to ensure a comprehensive experience.  Upon hire and through each staff member’s 
employment with RestorixHealth, staff competency will be established and periodically re evaluated through:  
o Onboarding and orientation processes 
o Competency assessment and review 
o Performance evaluation 
o Adherence to current policy and procedures 
• Each employee is expected to practice within their state-defined Scope of Practice or within the hospital-
defined scope, whichever is more conservative and according to state licensure or certification. 
PROCEDURE   
1. Review the components of the job description on the first day in the center. 
2. Ensure all staff working in the center adhere to the orientation guidelines set forth by contracted hospital.  
3. Provide general orientation and document on role-specific competency documents and/or the General 
Orientation and Clinical Competency checklists for all personnel. Utilize available 9925A addendums as 
appropriate.   
4. Clinical employees providing wound care shall complete additional training as required.  
5. Clinical employees providing HBO2 shall complete additional training as required by policy 9809.  
A. It is recommended that all hyperbaric staff with completed competencies maintain skills with their 
respective chambers and gas systems by ensuring hands-on time with the chambers every month, 
whether this is completing a patient treatment cycle, performing a chamber cycle while the chamber is 
empty, and/or assisting with chamber checklists daily and weekly. 
B. It is the responsibility of each staff member to inform their Program Director/Center Leader if they do not

PURPOSE 
To ensure consistency in application of wound and patient discharge outcome (status) definitions. 
DEFINITIONS 
Reoccurrence:  A wound or admission that is seen within 30 days of the last visit in the exact same anatomical 
location is not considered a new wound. To document: 
1. Remove previous discharge date and discharge status on Patient Admission screen.  
2. Change wound status to not healed and remove the resolution date. 
3. If less than 30 days but new wound, remove previous discharge date and discharge status on Patient 
Admission screen. Create a new wound. 
Delayed recurrence:  Any wound or admission that occurs 31 days or greater from the time the patient was last 
seen results in the addition of new wounds. If currently admitted, open a new wound.  If the patient is not 
admitted, add an admission to the patient admission screen and follow appropriate workflow. 
Verbal “Healed”:  When patients call to state their wound has healed or we call to remind a patient of an 
appointment and they decline stating their wound has healed, they should be encouraged to come in for a final 
appointment.  If they do not come in, follow the process established by the Performance Improvement team 
and/or contact your Regional Director of Clinical Training for guidance.    
Palliative:  Palliative care is conservative and recognizes that a patient’s wound will most likely not heal because 
the necessary intervention/modality is not available, not practical or which the underlying etiology does not 
respond to treatment, or the demands of treatment are beyond the person’s tolerance or stamina.   
Palliative status is determined and documented by the provider within the progress note.  It is highly 
recommended that a palliative patient be monitored by home health in coordination with their PCP. The goal for 
treatment may not be to heal a wound, but rather to prevent infection, hospitalization, etc.  Utilize the Palliative 
Decision Tool available in SharePoint to aid in determining status. 
It is possible with a change in a person’s overall medical condition that a palliative designation can occur later in 
the treatment plan. It is also possible that a patient will have a change in their condition that would improve 
potential to heal, thereby negating a palliative designation. 
Designate a patient as palliative by opening the Patient Dashboard and selecting the Palliative checkbox within 
the Admission widget.  A patient with a palliative designation on the Patient Admission screen in the EMR does 
not follow the 30-day discharge rules and will not be included in wound outcomes.  Document this change within 
the Communication Log. 
POLICY 
• Wounds that have been assigned a number and location will be given a wound outcome at the time of 
healing/known resolution. When treatment is discontinued or when a patient event such as a death, move, 
etc. occurs, the patient will be discharged with the appropriate patient status (admission screen in 
dashboard), wounds will not receive an outcome.

• All wounds are considered “not healed” until a wound outcome is assigned. A wound will be left as “not 
healed” when you do not know the outcome of the wound itself.  When wounds are not healed, only a patient 
status will be assigned. 
• Wound outcomes will allow the calculation of Days to Heal.  Wound and Patient outcomes allow the 
calculation of Healing Percent.  It is important to choose the most accurate outcomes to ensure proper 
calculation of center statistics.  With outcome calculation a patient wound status (positive, negative, neutral) 
trumps a patient outcome (positive, negative, neutral) EXCEPT in the case above (patient leaves our care 
before wounds heal) in that case for calculation purposes the patient status reason is utilized.  
• A patient not seen and/or a wound not measured in >30 days should be evaluated and receive the 
appropriate wound outcome and patient discharge outcome.  In case of a hospital admission, it is 
recommended to wait until 30 days have passed since the last visit before discharging from the center to 
alleviate any unnecessary readmission visits. 
Situation Wound Outcome Patient Outcome 
Patient active, 
wound(s) heal during 
course of treatment. 
Select a Wound Status.  
Based on your selection this will have a 
positive, negative, or neutral impact on 
outcome calculations. 
Remains “Active”. 
Patient is discharged. 
All wounds have

Patient is discharged. 
All wounds have not 
received an outcome. 
Wound Status remains as Not Healed. Select a Patient Status (Admissions screen on 
dashboard).  Based on your selection this will 
have a positive, negative, or neutral impact on 
outcome calculations. 
WOUND STATUS DEFINITIONS AND OUTCOMES: 
Wound outcomes, HBO outcomes and reasons for discharge fall into three categories: those that have a positive 
impact on the calculation of healed outcomes; those that are “non-healed” and therefore have a negative impact 
on the calculation of healed outcomes; and those that are non-healed but are considered to be “neutral” relative to 
impact on the calculation of healed outcomes. 
A. Amputation - Major (BKA or AKA, Negative):  Amputation necessary above or below the knee. Note: In 
the case of an amputation where patient surgical site is being cared for in center-that wound in Wound 
docs is discharged and a new wound is added. 
B. Amputation - Minor (all Other, Positive):   Amputation necessary which is located at or below the ankle. 
Note: If a diabetic ulcer is aggressively debrided, resulting in amputation of a toe but the wound is left 
open to heal by secondary intention, the wound retains its diabetic etiology and Wagner grading. No need 
to create a new wound number as maintaining a clean wound bed is imperative to wound healing.

C. Continued improvement expected post discharge (Positive):  The patient has clearly improved and 
continued improvement to resolution is anticipated following completion of therapy.  
D. Converted/Bridged (Neutral):  
1) Bridged defines an area of epithelization in the wound bed which separates one wound into two 
wounds.  Therefore, when it becomes two wounds, the largest wound stays as the existing wound 
number and the second wound is created.  There is no need to outcome the wound as it is still active. 
2) Converted defines two wounds which come together and make one larger wound. Therefore, when 
two wounds merge the largest wound will retain its wound number and the smaller wound would be 
assigned an outcome of Converted.   
E. Healed - new wound-prevent (Positive):  New wounds developed and could not reasonably have been 
prevented by the wound clinic through better care or preventive interventions, patient-acquired wound 
(i.e., patient burns himself due to soup spilled on lap, patient is bed bound and not turning even though 
the wound center has documentation of specific instructions). 
F. Healed - new wound-not prevent (Negative):  New wounds developed and could reasonably have been 
prevented through better care or preventive interventions on the part of the wound center (i.e., cast was 
applied without appropriate padding, compression was applied without vascular assessment and an 
additional wound developed).  
G. Healed - no new wound (Positive):  No occurrence of new wounds during the treatment course. 
H. No documented progress (Negative):  At the time treatment was stopped no documented progress had 
occurred. 
I. Not healed (Neutral):  This is not an outcome; it is a place holder status.  All wounds have this status until 
receiving an outcome.  If treatment is discontinued and the wound remains non-healed, an appropriate 
patient discharge status will be selected at the time of discharge and that designation will be considered 
the outcome for the wound(s). 
J. Secondary complication, wound related (Negative):  Wounds worsened, became larger or patient 
developed secondary complications because of the wound. 
K. Skin graft/flap - <95% but >50% take (Positive) 
L. Skin graft/flap - >95% take (Positive) 
M. Skin graft/flap - <50% (Negative) 
N. Surgical Closure (Positive):  Closure of a wound through surgical means. For patients with 
additional/multiple diabetic ulcers not healed with surgery- those wounds continue with appropriate 
grading and care based on their assessment. 
O. Worsening of disease course (Negative):  No modification of the disease course has occurred, and this 
outcome was not expected. *Provide explanation as to why expected outcome did not occur (secondary 
infection, inadequate off loading, poor compliance, etc.).  
PATIENT STATUS DEFINITIONS AND OUTCOMES: 
Patient discharge status (different from wound status) defaults automatically to “Active” at the time the patient is 
admitted, and treatment initiated. At the time treatment is ended, the selection of a description of “why is the 
patient no longer being treated” is to be selected from the following options:

assignment is made the same as for consult in that it is a “reason for discharge” that is assigned to the 
wound by virtue of it being active at the time of discharge. If the patient transfers or moves within these 2 
encounters - the patient discharge status in this example would be “Transferred” or “Moved” as 
appropriate. The “Transferred” or “Moved” outcome would automatically be assigned to any open 
wounds.

PURPOSE 
To have a standardized process to ensure the RestorixHealth Courtesy Transportation services follow CMS’s 
Regulatory Guidelines. RestorixHealth (RXH) offers courtesy transportation to patients who meet the eligibility

willingly offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce patient referrals or services reimbursable by a 
Federal or State Health Care Program (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) is a criminal offense.   
 
POLICY 
Under certain criteria, RXH may offer courtesy transportation where the welfare and positive healing outcome of 
the patient may be compromised due to the patient’s lack of ability to travel to the wound care facility for 
treatment. The Company has prepared this Courtesy Transportation Policy to address issues of financial need, 
limited transportation resources, treatment compliance and patient safety.   
 
SCOPE 
The scope of this Courtesy Transportation Policy applies to all RestorixHealth employees , Board of Directors, and 
entities with a business relationship with RestorixHealth. Compliance with the Courtesy Transportation Policy is 
mandatory and strict compliance with this policy and its requirements are a condition of employment. The 
company will take disciplinary action up to and including termination for violation thereof.

requirements must be met, including the completion of the Patient Transportation Eligibility 
Checklist, signed Transportation Program Notice and Attestation, and entered on the Courtesy 
Transportation Log. These are expensed through Concur by the Center Director (i.e., Program

b. For facilities located in a rural (Non-metropolitan Statistical Area, county) area, transportation is 
limited to a 75-mile radius (as the crow flies).  
• Note: If the patient lives in a rural area and must travel to a facility in an urban area, the same 75-
mile radius applies. 
• To determine if the patient lives in an urban area (the patient is considered rural otherwise), use 
this online tool: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/geotools.html     
6. Exceptions: 
a. Possible reasonable exceptions may exist, and all exceptions are to be reviewed on a case- by-

requires treatment at a particular facility. The exception must be approved by the Regional 
Director. The justification and approval must be noted in the Comments section of the Patient 
Transportation Eligibility Checklist and also recorded on the Courtesy Transportation Log. This 
would include all related factors supporting the medical necessity for the treatment the patient is 
receiving at the wound care center where courtesy transportation is being offered. Possible 
exceptions may include, but are not limited to:  
i. Milage or distance exceptions:  
1. No other wound care facility is closer to the patient (ex. may exceed distance 
limitations). 
2. A closer wound care center does not accept patient’s insurance.  
3. Family member(s) or caregivers are not available to provide transportation.

PURPOSE 
The purpose of the Medical Records policy is to ensure the following: 
• Proper maintenance of the medical record. 
• A complete medical record is available for each patient served at the wound care and/or hyperbaric center.  
• Staff have an awareness of the availability of EMR downtime forms.  
• A framework exists to describe the role of the scribe within the center. 
POLICY 
1. Patient records will be maintained in the center in such a way that the privacy of the records is protected .  
A. In some cases, the medical record may be a hybrid record, consisting of both electronic and paper 
documentation and may physically exist in separate and multiple locations in both paper and electronic 
formats. 
B. All documents that do not originate in the EMR should be scanned into the system and shredded.  
C. For security purposes, when the Center is closed, all computers are to be locked or powered down.  
D. Records will be released in accordance with hospital policy and procedure.  
E. Special care must be exercised with medical records protected by the state and federal laws covering 
mental health records, alcohol, and substance abuse records, reporting forms for suspected 
elder/dependent adult abuse, child abuse reporting and HIV-antibody testing and AIDS research. 
2. It is policy to document all care provided to demonstrate the application of a multidisciplinary standard of care, 
including procedures and the patient’s response to treatment. 
A. Documentation should be individualized for each patient at each encounter and based on their medical 
needs and clinical presentation.  
B. Copying/pasting templated data into the EMR without individualization to each patient or any other form of 
“note cloning” is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action. 
C. Documentation is to be made as soon as possible after care is provided or observation is made, and fully 
completed within 72 hours of the patient visit.  
D. All orders are to be signed by the provider on the date of service before leaving the center.  It is 
recommended that providers review charts after 24 hours to ensure all documentation has been signed. 
E. An entry should never be made in advance of the service provided to the patient. Pre- dating, pre-timing or 
backdating an entry is prohibited. 
F. Each clinic day all center staff should run and resolve their Signature Report prior to leaving the center.  
Additionally, the signature report should be run for the preceding 30 days to ensure all signatures are 
complete. 
G. When employees or providers leave employment, refer to the Signature Requirements  EMR Connection 
(available in SharePoint) to follow the most current process for resolution. 
3. When the course of treatment is complete, the entire medical record is stored on the contracted electronic 
system and is available to the contracted hospital as needed. Each hospital shall determine what content, if 
any, will be provided back to the hospital medical record.

Department and open the EMR Downtime Forms folder. Utilize these forms when the EMR is unavailable; 
refer to Downtime Forms Guide (available in SharePoint) for instructions.

providers as they are done and said during the patient visit. 
B. The scribe should not act independently and there is no billing for this activity.  
C. A notation of what was scribed shall be entered into the record. As an example- “I attest, as the nurse, 
that I scribed these orders for the physician.”

services and creating the record, which is simply "scribed" by another person.  
E. The provider is ultimately accountable for the documentation and should sign after the scribe's entry 
affirming the note accurately reflects work done by the provider. An attestation box/checkoff has been 
provided in the physician order screen.

Policy Title: OFFLOADING AND PRESSURE REDUCTION 
Department: Clinical Services Primary Owner: Blake Kostka 
Policy No: 9945 Prepared By: Christene Fenton 
Review Date: 12/27/2023 Approved By: William Tettelbach

PURPOSE 
Pressure is a common factor in the development of chronic wounds due to the repeated pressure and force. 
Offloading is an umbrella term used to describe the reduction of pressure and shear over an area of the body. 
Typically wounds over bony prominences, and in areas of repeated pressure, such as the bottom of the foot will 
require some form of offloading.  
Offloading and redistribution of pressure is not only imperative for the prevention of wounds, but also for healing 
existing wounds. Offloading provides tissue load management for weight-bearing surfaces. If done appropriately, 
this will maintain soft tissue viability, and promote wound healing. 
POLICY 
• All wounds require a close evaluation to determine if pressure reduction measures will be helpful in healing.  
Offloading needs to be considered for every ulcer and documented in the electronic record.  
• There are various offloading techniques to relieve pressure from the wound.  Items may be provided in the 
clinic or ordered through a DME vendor. 
o Total Contact Cast (TCC) is the industry preferred method for lower extremity offloading. Total contact 
casts are applied in the wound center and are non-removable by the patient which results in the greatest 
compliance.  
 Patients with a TCC may benefit from a cast protector (Drypro, etc.) to keep the cast dry when 
showering.   
 Typically, TCCs are changed once weekly but if combining with a VAC or for wounds with copious 
drainage, more frequent changes may be required. 
o Other options include wheelchair, crutches, rolling-knee walker, removable cast walker (RCW), modifiable 
shoes, heel floaters, low air loss mattresses, and custom prescription devices. These may be used alone 
or in combination to reduce pressure and shear.  
• Total contact cast should be used for every appropriate diabetic foot ulcer, but removable cast walkers 
(RCW), modified shoes, crutches, wheelchair, bed rest, heel floaters, and custom prescription devices may be 
appropriate in specific circumstances. 
• Consider ordering Physical Therapy assessment and gait training for patients who are receiving offloading for 
the first time and may be unstable. 
PROCEDURES 
1. Refer to the equipment manufacturer for specific instructions on prescribing and applying each offloading 
modality. 
2. Competency documentation should be completed before providing education or application of a pressure 
relief device (see 9925A Competency checklist). 
3. Record the method of offloading in the electronic record. Document as procedure if applicable. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS 
1. TCC is contraindicated in untreated infection.

3. Adjustments will need to be made to accommodate the patient’s ADLs. 
4. Considerations should be made when immobilizing and offloading the right foot in patients who drive.

management across the organization. This policy applies to WoundDocs Centers only.  
POLICY 
It is the policy of RestorixHealth to schedule all patients within the Electronic Medical Record, WoundDocs. This 
policy is only applicable to centers on WoundDocs. Users responsible for managing patient appointments should 
complete RXH L.I.V.E module, “Scheduling & Rescheduling Appointments” prior to working with the center

allocated to each visit/patient.  
B. Weekly wound care visits are the goal for most patients.  
C. HBO visits should be scheduled daily. 
D. HBO weekly provider visit, and Sub HBO 30-day visit should be scheduled a week in advance to ensure

4. Editing a Visit (Wound Care) 
A. If the patient calls to reschedule an appointment within the current week, the appointment should be 
edited, and the date and time of appointment should be updated to the new appointment date and time 
within current week (Monday-Friday).  
B. In the event of changing the level of service on a visit type (WC Follow-Up to Nurse Visit), the 
appointment should be edited, and the date, time, and appointment type should be updated. Please 
note, Nurse Visits require a physician order. 
C. If the appointment cannot be rescheduled within the current week, the visit should be changed to 
”Canceled – reason” (see below definitions) and a new visit should be created. 
D. If the patient/caregiver does not call to cancel or does not present to scheduled appointment, the 
appointment should be edited, selecting the “Missed No Show/No Call” reason.  
E. If the patient calls to cancel a scheduled appointment and does not reschedule, the appointment should 
be edited, and the appropriate cancellation reason should be selected.  
F. Visits within the current week should not be deleted from the calendar.  If a patient is not returning for 
future visits (i.e., patient dies or is discharged) after the current week, future visits can be deleted.  Place 
a note in the Communication Log including the appointment dates deleted.  
FOLLOW UP 
Every effort should be made to confirm and remind patients of their scheduled appointments prior to the visit date.  
Patients with missed/cancelled visits should be contacted within 24 hours to reschedule appointment, multiple 
attempts should be made.  
1. Primary care and/or referring provider should be notified if a patient is not seen in the center. 
2. Three attempts on three separate days should be made to reschedule the patient. 
3. On the calendar, select Missed/Modify and place a checkmark next to Missed Visit.  
4. All patient-related communications should be documented in the Communication Log on the patient 
dashboard (this includes missed visits, canceled visits, changed visits).  
5. Use Patient Non-Activity and Patient without Appointments reports to help manage the patient list.  
6. A patient not seen and/or a wound not measured in >30 days should be evaluated and receive the 
appropriate wound outcome and/or patient discharge outcome. The Patient Non-Activity Report is utilized to 
identify these patients. Refer to policy 9927. 
Note:  Best practice is to utilize Patient Without Appointment Report frequently, minimum of weekly. This 
ensures patients are scheduled in a timely manner.

To ensure the safe transfer of patient care and exchange of information between caregivers/departments. 
POLICY 
• It is the responsibility of the Center Leader to obtain the hospital guidelines/policy (i.e. I -PASS, SBAR, 
checklist, etc.) regarding handoff of patient care when a higher level of care is required.  Hospital policy 
should be placed in the front of the center’s policy manual. 
• A face-to-face handoff must occur in real-time whenever a patient is being transitioned to another care 
provider for the same or higher level of care i.e., hyperbaric oxygen therapy handoff or transfer to emergency 
care. 
• When transferring to a higher level of care, documentation must include a timeline of events and details of 
provider and clinician communication relative to the handoff. 
PROCEDURE 
1. When a transition to a higher level of care is required, provider-to-provider and/or clinician-to-clinician handoff 
must occur using the hospital-established communication method or checklist, if such tools exist.  
2. Handoff in the hyperbaric suite i.e., lunch relief, must take place in view of the patient(s). 
3. When the wound clinic or hyperbaric center is located within the hospital proper, the clinician will participate in 
transfers to the Emergency Department so a face-to-face handoff can occur.  
4. Following handoff to a higher level of care, fully document the details within the EMR, including c ircumstances 
around the transfer of care and the name of the individual who received the patient and report.   
5. If an adverse or sentinel event is suspected follow RestorixHealth policy 9923. 
AREAS TO CONSIDER: 
1. Use of one of the following mnemonics if hospital doesn’t have a consistent method:
