PURPOSE: 
Scanning is the point where images enter into the EPIC electronic medical record system. 
 
POLICY: 
Every patient’s medical record will be scanned into the system within a designated turnaround time by 
the Health Information Management Department. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. Charts will be retrieved, starting with the oldest discharge date for inpatient records and the 
oldest admit date for ambulatory records, from the shelf labeled “To Be Scanned.”  
2. Charts will be distributed among the staff, starting with the oldest discharge date for 
inpatient records and the oldest admit date for ambulatory records. 
3. Double-click the Hyland Onbase Unity Client icon on the desktop. 
4. Enter login ID and password on the Hyland Onbase Unity Client Logon Screen and press the 
enter key.  Select Batch Scanning on the Hyland Onbase Toolbar. 
5. Place the chart to be scanned in the tray and click the Scan button. 
6. The employee should pay close attention to the documents as they feed into the scanner to 
assure correct orientation of the documents and avoid possible double-feeds. 
7. In the event that the orientation of the document is incorrect or double feed occurs, stop the 
scanning process.  Pull the document(s) that need to be rescanned and begin scanning again 
from that document forward. 
8. The employee should also be watching for any lines appearing on the documents. This 
indicates that the scanner needs to be cleaned or the bulb needs to be changed.  2 
9. Put a rubber band or paper clip on the chart and placed in the correctly dated box with the 
appropriate batch header sheet (labeled Emergency, Ambulatory or Inpatient). 
10. All work that was not completed should be put back on the shelf so that the next shift can 
pick up where the first shift left off.  There should never be any work left on the top of 
terminals, in chairs, on desks, or unlabeled. 
11. Always clean the scanners at the end of every shift and as needed intermittently throughout 
the shift. 
12. For any maintenance problems, contact the Supervisor of the HIM department so she/he can 
contact a member of the Information Systems Team. 
13. Report any problems to the supervisor or a member of the management team.
