PURPOSE: 
To provide early identification of patients who would benefit from nutrition intervention. 
 
POLICY: 
All patients admitted to the Children’s Hospital will be screened for nutritional risk.  
 
1. A nutrition screening will be completed on all pediatric patients admitted to the Children’s Hospital

past medical history/diagnosis, home diet (including special formula, oral supplements, tube feeding, 
parenteral nutrition and modified diet), home oxygen/ventilator, and history of weight loss.   
 
2. For patients found to be nutritionally at risk, a nutrition assessment will be completed utilizing 
information such as weight, length/height, weight changes, eating problems, allergies, lab values, and 
growth patterns in addition to the screening criteria. 
 
 
3. Patients identified at nutritional risk will be rescreened/reassessed within the following timeframe: 
 
• Minimal – 7 days 
• Mild – 5 days 
• Moderate – 3 days 
• Severe – 2 days
