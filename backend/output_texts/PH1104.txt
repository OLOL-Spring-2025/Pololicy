POLICY: 
 
The pharmacy may loan a supply of medications to other healthcare organizations (e.g., community 
pharmacies and hospital pharmacies).  Loans shall be within the limits of the Prescription Drug Marketing 
Act of 1987 and regulations set forth by the FDA Drug Quality and Security Act Title II, the Drug Supply 
Chain Security Act (DSCSA).  
 
Medications loaned to entities not affiliated with FMOLHS must address a specific and immediate patient 
need and must not be for the purpose of increasing or replenishing stock in anticipation of a potential need.  
 
CONTAINERS AND LABELS 
 
Medications supplied to other healthcare organizations shall be in manufacturer-labeled, original 
containers or in containers that are identified and labeled so that recalls can be affected as necessary and 
proper controls established.  
 
QUANTITIES TO LOAN 
 
The pharmacy may buy/sell/loan medications that it normally stocks.  Quantities loaned shall not exceed 
five percent of the pharmacy's total purchases.  
 
RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS 
 
Records of transactions shall be made on a buy/sell form, or similar record. The buy/sell form should serve 
as an invoice for the borrowing facility to pay for the medications borrowed from our facility.  
 
MEDICATION RETURNS 
 
Returned medications may be accepted from other FMOLHS facilities. Return transactions must be 
recorded in the same manner as all other tran sactions. Returned medications cannot be accepted from 
facilities that are unaffiliated with FMOLHS unless the facility can provide transaction history and 
transaction statement via a secure, electronic mechanism as outlined by the DSCSA.
