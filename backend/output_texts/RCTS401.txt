Physical therapy is a vital part of the total care of patients who have temporary or permanent disabilities due to 
illness, injury, or disease.  The physical therapist works in conjunction with physicians and other health care 
professionals in an effort to assist each patient to achieve maximal performance so that he/she may assume a 
useful role in society while learning to live within the limits of his/her physical capabilities. 
 
Objectives: 
 
1. To restore function. 
 
2. To achieve maximal level of independent performance and restore quality of life. 
 
3. To educate patient and family members.
