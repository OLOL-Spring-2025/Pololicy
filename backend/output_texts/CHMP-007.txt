PURPOSE: 
 
To develop guidelines for the use of antibiotic lock therapy in the treatment of non-hemodialysis central line-
associated blood stream infections (CLABSI), central venous line (CVL) infections, and any other indication 
deemed necessary. 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Antibiotic lock therapy consists of filling and closing a central venous catheter lumen with an antibiotic solution 
and then allowing it to dwell for a period of time while the catheter is idle.  Antibiotic lock therapy should not be 
used alone for the treatment of CLABSI.  Instead, it should be used in conjunction with systemic antimicrobial 
therapy.  Several antibiotics have been used in antibiotic lock therapy, with vancomycin and gentamicin being 
the most commonly utilized.   
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Patient Selection for Antibiotic Lock Therapy 
 
Antibiotic lock therapy is indicated for patients with CLABSI involving long-term catheters with no signs of 
exit site or tunnel infection for whom catheter salvage is the goal. 
 
II. Prescribing 
 
A. Antibiotic lock therapy may be ordered with consultation of Infectious Diseases recommendation.  The 
prescriber will enter an order denoting the specific solution requested the exact volume of solution to be 
instilled into the catheter, and how often each dwell will last. 
            To estimate the volume of the central venous catheter, the nurse will use one of the following methods: 
1. The following table can be used if the length of the central catheter is known: 
 
Type of CVC Catheter size 
(internal diameter) Number of lumens Volume (mL) 
Broviac 2.7 Fr Single 0.15 
Broviac 4.2 Fr Single 0.3 
Broviac 6.6 Fr Single 0.7 
Hickman 9.0 Fr Dual 1.3/0.6 
Hickman 7.0 Fr Dual 0.8/0.6 
Hickman 9.6 Fr Single  1.8 
Hickman 12.5Fr Triple 1.6/0.7/0.7 CHMP-007

2. To estimate the central venous catheter, the nurse will use a syringe and measure the volume required 
until the first drops of blood enter the syringe.  This is the volume of the central venous catheter lumen.   
a. The prescriber will add an additional 0.1 mL to this measured volume for patients < 15 kg or an 
additional 0.2 mL to this measured volume for patients ≥15 kg to ensure the volume of the 
antibiotic lock covers the entire length of the central venous catheter lumen.   
b. The maximum antibiotic lock volume is 3 mL.   
c. An order should be entered to inform all patient caregivers of the estimated volume of the central 
venous catheter lumen. 
 
3. If unable to determine the volume of the central venous catheter lumen using the methods mentioned in 
either “1” or “2”, the following table can use used to estimate the volume of the central venous catheter: 
 
Weight of patient (kg) Volume of antibiotic lock if 
undetermined volume 
0-4.9 0.1 mL 
5-9.9 0.2 mL 
10-14.9 0.3 mL 
15-19.9 0.4 mL 
20-24.9 0.5 mL 
25 or greater 0.7 mL 
           Data supplied by Daniel H. Teitelbaum, MD, University of Michigan, C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital 
 
B. The following antibiotics may be ordered for antibiotic lock therapy: 
1. Vancomycin 5 mg/mL in NS 
2. Gentamicin 5 mg/mL in NS 
3. Cefazolin 10 mg/mL in NS 
4. Any other antibiotic requested for antibiotic lock therapy will require consultation and approval by 
the Section of Infectious Diseases and Pharmacy. 
 
III. Administration 
 
A. Administration of the antibiotic lock therapy may be performed by a nurse or at home by the patient or 
caregiver that has demonstrated competency in line care. 
 
B. The central venous catheter will be flushed with normal saline before instillation of the antibiotic lock 
solution. 
1. The antibiotic lock solution will have a dwell time of once per day during a period of time that the 
patient is off IV medications and/or parenteral nutrition given through the central venous catheter.   
2. Minimum dwell time will be four hours 
3. Maximum dwell time will be 24 hours.   
4. When the specified dwell time is complete, the antibiotic lock solution will be withdrawn from the 
line and discarded.  
5. If the antibiotic lock solution is unable to be withdrawn, the solution should be flushed through the 
line, followed by normal saline, and the primary team should be notified.  
6. When scheduling conflict exist with dwell time and medication administration consult with 
pharmacy.  
 
C. The duration of antibiotic lock therapy will be 10-14 days in attempt to salvage the catheter.
