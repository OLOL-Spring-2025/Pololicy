PURPOSE: 
To assist clinical departments in the selection and proper use of disinfectants. 
 
POLICY:  
Medical devices and patient care equipment are to be disinfected or sterilized according to the 
manufacturersâ€™ guidelines. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
Instruments and items for patient care are to be divided into three categories using the Spaulding 
Classification System, based on the degree of risk of infection involved in the use of the items.  The three 
categories of items are critical, semi-critical, and noncritical. 
 
1. Critical medical devices or patient-care equipment are items that enter normally sterile tissue or the 
vascular system through which blood flows.  These items require high level disinfection and 
sterilization. 
A. Examples:  Surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, implants, and ultrasound probes used in sterile 
body cavities 
B. Method: Steam, gas, and sporocidal chemical sterilization 
 
2. Semi-critical medical devices or patient-care equipment are items that come in contact with mucous 
membrane or nonintact skin.  These items require high-level disinfection. 
A. Examples: Endoscopes, Respiratory Equipment, Specula and Anesthesia equipment 
B. Method: Sporicidal chemical high-level disinfection 
 
3. Noncritical medical devices or patient-care equipment are items that come in contact with inta ct skin 
but not mucous membrane.  These items require low-level disinfection. 
A. Examples: Blood pressure cuffs, bedpans, bed rails, and bedside tables 
B. Method: Chemical exposure to low-level disinfectants (an EPA-registered disinfectant/detergent)
