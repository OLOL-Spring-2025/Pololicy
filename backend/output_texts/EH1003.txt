3. Review of On-the-job Accidents and Injuries 
 Employee Health reviews all incidents of employee work related accidents and injuries.  
Occupational Blood and Body Fluid Exposures are followed by Employee Health and evaluated 
by Lake Line Direct.  OSHA Reportable injuries are listed on the OSHA 300 log and reported to 
the Department of Labor by Risk Management.  Worker Compensation cases are followed by the 
Workers Compensation Coordinator. 
 
 
 
4. Tuberculin (TB) Screening  2 
 Employee Health reviews all employee and volunteer TB screenings.  Any employee that 
converts their TB skin test from negative to positive will complete a TB Assessment form and 
adhere to OLOL's policy EH1002. 
 
5. Hepatitis B Vaccination Program 
 Employee Health administers the Hepatitis B vaccination program.  Free Hepatitis B vaccine is 
offered to employees identified as being at risk for occupational exposure to blood and body 
fluids.   
 
6.   Influenza Vaccination Program 
 Employee Health administers the Annual Influenza Vaccination Program that is offered to all 
employees; and volunteers in the fall and early winter, yearly.  (See Influenza Vaccination 
Program policy.) 
 
7. Pertussis Vaccination Program

who have contact with patients less than 12 months of age.   
 
8.   Meningococcal Vaccination Program 
 Employee Health offers the Meningococcal Vaccination to employees who work in the 
Microbiology Lab. 
 
9. Control of Communicable Diseases 
 Employee Health offers assessment for communicable disease to employees when employees 
have been exposed, or are experiencing clinical symptoms at work, and applies restriction from 
work guidelines according to the disease or illness.  (See Employee Communicable Disease in 
the Workplace policy.) 
 
10. Return to Work Clearance 
 Employees are required to report to Employee Health before returning to work after missing 
more than 3 calendar days due to illness.  A physicianâ€™s statement is required for employees to 
return to work (OrgOps/HR/E/001).  If on medical leave of absence for their own health (FMLA) 
the employee must report to Employee Health with a fitness-for-duty certification from their 
health care provider before returning to work. (OrgOps/HR/P/007). 
 
11. Documentation of Glove Allergy 
 Employee Health documents employee glove allergies and dermatitis problems. 
 
12. Respiratory Mask TB Fit Testing 
 Fit tested for N-95 respirators is recommended for all hospital employees with direct patient 
contact. The purpose of the fit test is to ensure that the size of the N-95 mask chosen by the 
wearer offers the best protection from organisms carried as small particles over long distances. 
Fit testing also provides the employee the opportunity to understand how to properly don a 
respiratory device to prevent inward flow of contaminated air. The following departments and 
job titles are required to be fitted during orientation and annually thereafter.   3
