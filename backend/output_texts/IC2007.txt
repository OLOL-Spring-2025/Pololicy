PURPOSE: 
To state the appropriate disposal of needles/sharps within the Medical Center to ensure the safety for all 
healthcare workers, patients, and guests. 
 
POLICY: 
1. Needles/Sharps will be handled and disposed of in a manner: 
a. To minimize risk for all healthcare workers, patients, guests, and contracted waste handlers. 
b. To comply with Louisiana Public Health - Sanitary Code Part XXVII - Chapter 3 - Management of 
Infectious Waste, Medical Waste and Potentially Infectious Biomedical Waste. 
c. To comply with OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard 1910.1030. 
 
2. Sharps containers will be placed in areas accessible for disposal. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. Needles/Syringes should have safety mechanism activated (when using safety device) then discard 
intact, uncut, and unsheathed (uncapped) into the needle box (sharps container). Re-capping should be 
avoided. If re-capping is necessary, it should be done carefully on a level surface using a one-handed 
method.  
 
2. IVPB needles should be discarded by disassembling from tubing or cut tubing with needle attached or 
discard the whole tubing with needle attached into sharps container. 
 
3. Other sharp object s (i.e. scalpels, glass tubes, lancets, glass fragments) may  be placed into sharps 
containers. 
 
4. Needle cutters will not be used as this could result in aerosolization of blood particles. 
 
5. In non-nursing departments, sharps containers will be placed in designated areas where they will be 
accessible during the delivery of patient care. 
 
6. In patient rooms, sharps containers will be placed in a wall module enclosed unit (in-room disposal). 
 
7. Sharps containers will be changed when the level of syringes is 3/4 full. 
 
8. The sharps containers will be inspected and changed daily, if necessary. Sharps containers are enclosed 
in wall modules located in patient care areas.  Departments who do not use the wall module units shall 
be responsible for inspecting and changing containers as needed. 9. Sharps containers will be securely closed prior to disposal.  Departments who change their own sharps 
containers shall place used sharps containers in designated pick-up areas within their department (i.e. 
soiled utility rooms) for scheduled pick-ups. 
 
10. Sharps in the Operating Room (OR) will be handled in accordance with current OR policy (use of 
needle boxes and sharps containers.) 
 
11. Sharps are considered potentially infectious waste and will be transported  to a contracted infectious 
waste disposal handler for proper destruction.
