PURPOSE:  
To establish criteria for Our Lady of the Lake (OLOL) sponsored residents participating in Moonlighting 
activities  
 
DEFINITIONS: 
When used in this policy, these terms have the following meaning: 
 
Moonlighting:  Professional activities outside of the scope of the residency program, which includes 
volunteer work or service in a clinical setting, or employment that is not required by the residency 
program.  
 
Internal Moonlighting: Moonlighting within the residency program, the sponsoring institution and/or the 
program’s primary clinical site 
 
Pharmacy Resident (“resident”):  a pharmacist in a post-graduate education training program. 
 
Residency Program Director:  the pharmacist responsible for the direction, conduct, and oversight 
of the residency program. 
 
POLICY: 
 
A. Residency training is a full -time educational endeavor. It will be  the responsibility of the 
Residency Program Director to ensure that the resident’s moonlighting activities do not interfere 
with the ability of the resident to achieve the goals and objectives of the program, the resident’s 
educational performance, nor the resident’s opportunities for rest, relaxation, and independent 
study. It is the sole discretion of each Residency Program Director to determine whether 
outside activities interfere with the responsibilities, duties and assignments of the residency 
program. Should adverse effects be noted, the Residency Program Director may withdraw 
approval for and/or restrict the resident’s moonlighting activities. 
 
B. Residents cannot be required to engage in moonlighting activities.  
 
 C. Residents requesting approval for moonlighting must complete and submit to the Residency 
Program Director an OLOL  Resident Moonlighting Request form  indicating the  nature, 
duration and location of the outside activity. Approved request s must be signed by the 
Residency Program Director and maintained as a part of the resident’s permanent record. If 
the resident does not comply with this request for permission to moonlight, it is grounds for 
disciplinary action/dismissal. 
 
D. All moonlighting activities will be counted toward the 80-hour weekly limit on duty hours. 
 
E. It is the responsibility of the resident to obtain and provide professional liability insurance 
(malpractice) coverage for all moonlighting/other professional activities which are not an 
official part of the resident’s training program. 
 
F. Moonlighting is not allowed nor approved during the first six (6) months of the residency 
year.  
 
G. Documentation of resident moonlighting is part of all internal reviews and American Society 
of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) site visit.
