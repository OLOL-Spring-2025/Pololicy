PURPOSE: 
Our Lady of the Lake Health (OLOL) is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment 
and to protecting staff from injury or death caused by uncontrolled electrical hazards at all locations 
where OLOL operates. 
 
POLICY: 
Because of safety and insurance regulations, it is necessary to manage the use of personally owned 
electrical equipment being brought into OLOL.  
1. All electrical equipment brought into any OLOL location for personal or professional non-
medical use and not property of OLOL, must primarily be approved for use by department 
leadership.   
2. Department leadership is responsible to visually inspect equipment periodically and to consult 
Biomedical Engineering (Biomed) and/or Plant Services, if needed. 
3. Equipment owner is responsible for any needed repairs and product replacement. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
 
General 
1. All electrical equipment will have the manufacturer’s name or trademark.  The equipment will 
also have its operating voltage, current, wattage or other rating clearly marked on it. 
2. Patients are permitted to use no more devices than can be accommodated by existing power 
outlets. 
3. All equipment is UL approved for the use for which it is designed. 
4. Personal kitchen appliances, including those on the prohibited list, may be used for an event, but 
must be brought home immediately after use. 
 
Prohibited (except for designated areas, such as hospital cafeteria) 
Electric skillets Hot plates Gas/Electric Grills 
Toasters Toaster ovens Deep Fryers 
Air Fryers Electric Fryers  
Single cup coffee or soup heaters with exposed heater element

Portable Space Heaters 
1. Personal portable electric space heaters are not allowed at OLOL locations.  Exceptions to this 
rule is allowed if all the following are done: 
1. Must be approved by area leadership.  (Appendix A) 
 
2. Must be owned and maintained by OLOL.  
a. The following safety criteria must be met, and operational safety precautions must be 
followed: 
 The equipment is UL or ETL approved for the use for which it is designed. 
 The equipment has a sealed element, and does not produce any flames, fumes, or 
use any fuel. 
 The equipment is equipped to turn off automatically when tilted or turned over. 
 The equipment has an automatic overheat sensor/temperature regulator. 
 
3. Must be used as a temporary measure with no more than one heater every 300 sq feet. 
 
4. The user of the heater is ultimately responsible for any hazard or fire code violation 
created as a result of unauthorized or inappropriate use. Compliance with the following 
operational safety precautions is required: 
a. Always maintain a minimum clearance of three feet between materials and the 
heating device. Not to be used under a desk. 
b. Never leave the heating unit “ON” when unattended. 
c. Plug the heating unit directly into an outlet with enough capacity. Only one heater per 
outlet. 
d. Never use an extension cord or power strip with heater because it may overheat and 
cause a risk of fire.  
e. Check the heating unit before each use to make sure that all indicator lights are 
working.  Remove the defective unit from service immediately. 
f. Ensure that the power cord is properly plugged in and is not damaged, or crushed by 
objects, or covered under carpet or rug. 
 
5. The use of heating pads and electric blankets used for this purpose is prohibited.  
 
Lockout/Tagout 
1. Qualified employees will use lockout/tagout procedures on all electrical equipment while 
completing maintenance work. Lockout/tagout procedures are found in OLOL’s Lockout/Tagout 
Policy. If the equipment cannot be deenergized because it would introduce an additional or 
increased hazard, or it is infeasible due to the design or its operational limitations (i.e. emergency 
alarm systems), OLOL will hire a qualified electrical contractor to perform the work.  
 
Department Responsibilities 
1. Each department is responsible to identify types of non-patient care equipment that may pose an 
electrical hazard during intended use.  If there is any question as to the safety of the equipment, 
Plant Services should be consulted. 
 
2. Each department is to ensure that all electrical equipment in their department is safe for use.  ECSF013

Extension Cords, Power Strips, and Multi-Outlet Adapters 
1. Employees must be aware of the hazards associated with the misuse of extension cords and 
relocatable power taps (RPT)s and power strips. Extension cords are prohibited except for 
emergency situations where either Biomed or Plant Services has approved the device for 
temporary use.  When possible, installation of additional electrical outlets is preferred.   
 
2. All power strips must be UL listed and used according to the manufacture’s guidelines.  
Relocatable Power Taps (RPT)s may be used for non-patient care equipment such as 
computers/monitors/printers, and in areas such as waiting rooms, offices, nurse stations, support 
areas, corridors, etc.  
 
3. Precautions needed if RPTs are used include:  
• ensuring they are never “daisy-chained”. 
• preventing cords from becoming tripping hazards 
• installing internal ground fault and over-current protection devices 
– using power strips that are adequate for the number and types of devices used.  
 
4. Multi-Outlet Adapters are prohibited. 
 
Remote Power Tap (Power Strip) Requirements in Patient Care Areas 
1. Power strips may be used in a patient care vicinity to power rack-, table-, pedestal-or cart-
mounted patient care-related electrical equipment assemblies, provided all the following 
conditions are met:  
• The receptacles are permanently attached to the equipment assembly.  
• The sum of the ampacity of all appliances connected to the receptacles shall not exceed 75 
percent of the ampacity of the flexible cord supplying the receptacles. 
• The ampacity of the flexible cord is suitable in accordance with the current edition of NFPA 
70, National Electric Code.  
• The electrical and mechanical integrity of the assembly is regularly verified and documented 
through an ongoing maintenance program. 
 
2. Power strips providing power to rack-, table-, pedestal-, or cart-mounted patient care-related 
electrical equipment assemblies are not required to be an integral component of manufacturer 
tested equipment.  
 
3. Power strips may be permanently attached to mounted equipment assemblies by personnel who 
are qualified to ensure compliance. 
 
4. Power strips providing power to patient care-related electrical equipment in use with patients 
must be listed as UL1363A or UL60601-1 compliant.
