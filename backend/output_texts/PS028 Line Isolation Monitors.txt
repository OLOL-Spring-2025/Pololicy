POLICY: 
Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) Plant Services shall maintain, test run, and 
render to a state of preparedness at all times the Emergency Generator(s)  at any location where OLOL 
operates. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
NO LOAD RUN: Weekly the emergency generator(s) will be started for testing the initial startup and 
batteries.  The battery cells shall also be tested for specific gravity ensuring a state of readiness of the 
engine set. This run time must be logged along with the below information requested.  
 
The following information is recorded on each no load run: 
• Hose conditions 
• Belt conditions 
• Coolant levels 
• Oil levels  
• Fuel levels  
• Battery cable conditions 
• Block heater working 
• Main breakers closed  
• Any leaks are repaired or evaluated for future scheduled attention. 
• Initial start is documented. 
 
Startup procedures shall include a pre and post run inspection. Actual start up shall be manual. 
 
FULL LOAD RUN: Plant Services shall test run the Emergency Generator under load conditions for a 
period not less than 30 minutes each month. 
 
Startup of generators shall be by simulated power failure. This power failure is caused by manually 
causing an outage on a single ATS switch which is rotated every month.  
 
Once the initial ATS swaps under load, all additional ATS (including any fire pumps) on the EPS are 
manually forced to swap load to the generator.    
 
The following information is recorded on each full load run: 
• Transfer time (Under 10 seconds per code) 
• Current

• Power  
• Voltage  
• Engine readings 
• Specific gravity test on batteries (monthly requirement)  
 
All discrepancies shall be noted on log form and be corrected immediately.  Any failures are corrected 
or Interim Life Safety Measure (ILSM) is implemented. 
 
Each generator inspection (weekly) and load test (monthly) is documented and kept in the hospital’s 
regulatory records.
