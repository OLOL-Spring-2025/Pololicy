Purpose 
To establish and provide documentation of ocular health for surgical services staff and 
physicians. 
 
Policy 
Medical Surveillance (Eye Examination) is required for Class 3b and Class 4 laser users.  It shall 
be performed prior to laser exposure and upon an actual or a suspected incidence of injury.  All 
individuals who are at risk from laser hazards will be identified and assessed to determine a 
baseline level of ocular performance and evaluated after an injury or incident has occurred. 
 
Procedure 
 
1. All Surgical Services employees who work with laser systems will have the following 
ocular exam performed during the pre-employment assessment and after an injury: 
a. Ocular History 
b. Visual Acuity 
c. Macular function (Amsler Grid) 
 
2. In the event of abnormal results on the Amsler grid screening, the employee will schedule 
an appointment with their ophthalmologist of choice at their earliest convenience and will 
return the completed release to work form to Employee Health to be maintained in the 
employeeâ€™s medical file. 
 
3. Any laser accident, no matter how minimal, will require a safety event report.  Employee 
Health and the supervisor will determine at the time of the accident if an ocular 
evaluation is necessary.  The employee involved in the laser accident will have an 
immediate, complete ophthalmologic examination by their ophthalmologist of choice.
