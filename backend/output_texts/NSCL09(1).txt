Oral supplements are provided based upon MD order, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist ( RDN) order, or 
per nursing request. 
 
Oral supplement orders must be entered into the Epic electronic medical record by an MD or RDN order. 
[Reference policy NSCL01 for order privilege]. Oral supplements will interface via real time to the CBord 
system and be delivered with the patientâ€™s meal tray.   
 
Oral supplements are prepared by Food and Nutrition Services  and delivered as part of the meal tray to 
patient rooms. If a patient refuses snacks or oral supplements, the RDN may adjust or discontinue  the 
order. Nursing units may order individualized items for floor stock which can be provided as snacks per 
patient/family request as compliant with the prescribed diet order.
