Purpose:  
The Bomb Threat Plan is to provide for the safety of the patients, visitors, and personnel during bomb threat situations or 
events. 
 
Authorization to Activate 
1. The Administrator on Call (AOC) and/or the Chief Operating Officer (COO) in coordination with the Regulatory 
Safety Officer will determine and activate the Hospital Incident Command System and the emergency event plan 
for a Bomb Threat. 
2. The Incident Commander will determine and activate the appropriate HICS positions to respond to the incident. 
3. Upon notification of a potential bomb threat or event, the Incident Commander will designate an area for the 
Incident Briefing and notify the House Manager and Director/Shift Supervisor of Security to report to the 
designated area. 
4. Local police and fire departments should be notified.  DO NOT NOTIFY THE NEWS MEDIA.   Information to 
the Public Media (press, television, and radio) will be given only by the Director of Public Relations, or the 
Hospital Chief Executive Officer or Designee. 
 
Mitigation: 
1. This policy was developed in response to the results of the Hazard Vulnerability Analysis which identified a 
bomb threat as a low risk to this campus. 
2. Safety measures and preventative techniques brought about through inspection of the hospital, conducted in 
coordination with environment of care rounding, the safety officer and plant operations departments’ preventive 
maintenance program, should continue on a routine basis.  During the inspection of the building, particular 
attention should be given to such areas as rest rooms, ceiling areas and other areas which are used as a means of 
immediate access to plumbing and electrical fixtures.  Other areas to be included in an inspection are access 
doors, crawl spaces, utility and closet areas, stairwells, boiler rooms, flammable storage areas, fire extinguishers 
and fire monitoring devices, record storage areas and indoor trash receptacles. 
 
Preparedness: 
 
In preparation of responding to a bomb threat all personnel are responsible for knowing their individual roles at all times.  
All personnel should know and practice the following guidelines and procedures: 
1.  Remain alert to suspicious activities, packages, and personnel on hospital property 
2.   Report your observation to security and local authorities 
a. All personnel should be alert to suspicious looking or suspicious acting people, people who are 
inappropriately dressed for the season, or people running from the building. 
b. All personnel should be alert to foreign or suspicious objects, items, or parcels, which appear in an area where 
such items or parcels are not normally observed.

Bomb Threat by Mail: 
 
1. If you receive a letter that contains a threat of bombing or a demand for extortion you should remember to: 
• Immediately place the page(s) and the envelope between two blank pieces of paper 
• DO NOT handle the pages or envelope any more than necessary 
2. If you find or receive a suspicious package you should remember to: 
• DO NOT handle package. 
• Help secure the threatened area until the AOC, Director/ Shift Supervisor of Security, or local Law 
Enforcement arrives. 
3.    Notify Security and House Supervisor Immediately and wait for direction to call a CODE BLACK. 
• Announce the following: “CODE BLACK. We are maintaining radio silence.  Please refrain from using 
cellular phones until further notice.  Thank you.”   
• Special Procedures: 
If a suspected bomb is located or if a suspected location of a bomb is determined, the following guidelines 
MUST be followed: 
• DO NOT APPROACH THE SUSPECTED BOMB OR ATTEMPT TO HANDLE OR REMOVE IT.  
The explosives must not be jarred, tilted or turned in any way.  Anything connected to a suspected 
bomb should be left untouched, as it may be a triggering mechanism. 
• If a danger zone is identified, the area should be blocked off or barricaded until the bomb or suspicious 
object has been removed or disarmed or danger has otherwise passed. 
• Should administration implement the internal disaster response for evacuation of the hospital, efforts 
should be taken to remove all personnel to a safe distance from the building to protect them from debris 
and other flying objects in the event there is an explosion.  If the building is evacuated, all electricity, 
gas and fuel lines, flammable liquids will be either shut off or removed from the area. 
• PANIC MUST BE AVERTED.  Panic on the part of patients may cause more injury than that of an 
explosion; therefore, all personnel are requested to conduct all searches in an orderly and non-disruptive 
manner.
