Your health plan has not authorized payment to Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOLRMC) for 
the services you are seeking.   Since your health plan has not authorized payment, you are accepting financial 
responsibility for these services. 
OLOLRMC will continue to attempt to contact your health plan to obtain authorization. If your health plan denies 
authorization of payment for these services, you will be financially responsible for the services rendered on this date.  
If you have any further questions regarding your individual health plan coverage, you may call your health plan 
directly.
