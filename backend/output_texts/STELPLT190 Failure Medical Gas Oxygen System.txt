Policy: 
  
In the event of a malfunction and/or failure of the oxygen system, the following procedure will be 
followed: 
  
Responsibility: 
  
Plants Operations 
  
Procedure: 
  
1. Notify the Manager of Facilities or Supervisor, Administrative Supervisor/designee and     
       Respiratory Therapy. 
  
2.                  Attempt to identify cause for oxygen system failure.  Use extreme caution: the risks of 
 combustion are much greater in an environment of pure oxygen.  Avoid skin contact with liquid   
 oxygen due to its extremely low temperature.  NO SMOKING! 
  
3.                   Ensure that the reserve supply is on-line. 
  
4.                   If both the main oxygen supply and the reserve oxygen supply have been disabled and the   
   problem is not remedied immediately, notify the Plant Operations Department to deliver   
   portable cylinders to the critical care areas immediately. 
  
5.                   Request emergency delivery of oxygen, as needed, from AIR GAS, Acct #55081 @ 
  1- 800-323-1970. 
  
6.                   Plant Operations personnel will make minor repairs, if it is out of their capability to repair,   
   outside assistance from AIR GAS, Acct #55081 @ 1-800-323-1970 may be required     
   as needed. 
  
7.                   If test of the oxygen systems is necessary, coordinate them with the Cardiopulmonary  
               Department personnel and notify the House Supervisor, as well as all departments affected  
    within the hospital.
