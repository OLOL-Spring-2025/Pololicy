PURPOSE: 
  To identify correct handling of liquid helium and liquid nitrogen in the MR area. 
POLICY: 
A. Under no circumstance should liquid helium and liquid nitrogen be 
transferred into the magnet prior to installation of the quench pipe exhaust. 
B. Under no circumstances should a container be brought into the magnet 
area, unless it is known that it is made of non-ferrous material. It is 
extremely dangerous to personnel and equipment to bring any ferrous 
metal objects into the magnet area. Special non-ferrous metal objects are 
available from the liquid gas suppliers and must be so specified and 
appropriately labeled. 
C. MRI systems with a superconductive magnet are equipment with a 
QUENCH PIPE, which prevents evaporation of nitrogen and helium into 
the examination room. 
D. Properties of helium and nitrogen: 
1. Odorless 
2. Non-flammable 
3. Non-poisonous 
4. On evaporation, a cold mist is formed. Helium will rise and 
nitrogen will descend to ground level. 
5. Harmful for health as it will dilute the oxygen in the air.
