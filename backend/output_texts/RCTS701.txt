After a catastrophic injury or illness, a patient spends many hours trying to control his body and regain confidence 
in himself.  Often, with this rigorous routine, a patient loses the necessary balance of work, rest, and leisure.  
Leisure activities generally provide a sense of pleasure, challenge, social integration, and relaxation.  A disabled 
person frequently can continue previous leisure activities with adaptation and learn new activities.  The same 
activities can be used to integrate new skills. 
   
It is the goal of the Activity Therapist to assess and develop the patient’s leisure interests.  This may entail 
adapting previously enjoyed activities and/or introducing new ones. 
 
Once skills are attained, community re-entry activities are used to apply these skills in their actual settings.  
Socialization is emphasized, as well as problem solving insecurities, physical barriers, etc. 
 
The Activity Therapist works closely with the other members of the treatment team to incorporate overall 
treatment goals.
