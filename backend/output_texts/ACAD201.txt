Documentation of the assessment findings will be done following the documentation 
guidelines for the department.  
Inpatient assessment findings will be documented in the patient’s electronic medical 
record (EMR) within 48 hours of receipt of the order unless the assessment is not able to 
be completed based on the Patient’s unstable medical condition or patient’s refusal to 
participate. Documentation will be made electronically explaining the reason for the 
delay in completing the assessment. When the assessment is complete, the assessment 
findings will be documented electronically in the patient’s EMR. 
At the completion of each day, it is the treating therapist’s responsibility to make sure 
that all assessment/treatment notes have been properly documented. 
 
Referrals for Assessment by Other Providers 
A request for assessment/treatment by other services will be made when one or more of 
the following occur: 
• the patient presents with one or more of the screening/trigger criteria that have been 
identified by those departments 
• the caregiver identifies any other deficit that requires therapeutic intervention from 
another discipline 
• the caregiver identifies a learning need that can best be addressed by another service 
(i.e. diabetes counseling, nutrition counseling etc…) 
 
   Referrals will be made in the following manner: 
 
• For treatment requiring physician's orders, the physician will be contacted for 
consultation and request of the order.  This may be done at the provider's discretion 
using any of the acceptable communication procedures available (documentation of 
request in EMR, proposed order in EMR, phone call, communication through 
multidisciplinary team meetings, etc.) 
• For needs not requiring physician's orders, the provider will contact the involved 
service or discipline directly and coordinate the referral process. 
 
Ongoing Assessment 
 
In addition to the formal assessment and reassessments that are performed based on the 
above time frames and criteria, the patient is assessed for response to treatment and 
change in needs at each visit.  This assessment may include vital signs, strength, range of 
motion, endurance and other indicators that measure progress or lack of progress.  The 
ongoing assessments may be performed by a therapist or assistant within the scope of the 
provider's competence and practice as allowed by law.  Non-licensed personnel involved 
in the care of the patient, will report any noted signs, symptoms or subjective data to the 
provider responsible for the patient so that this data can be included in the overall 
assessment and care of the patient.

UTILIZATION OF ASSESSMENT DATA 
 
All assessment data will be documented in the EMR as outlined in documentation 
guidelines.  This data will be utilized to establish priorities for care and develop a plan of 
care, educational plan and goals for patient treatment.  The initial and subsequent 
measurements will be used to determine progress of the patient and to re-evaluate needs 
during the care process.
