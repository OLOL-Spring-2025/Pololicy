placed on a transport vent by a respiratory therapist. Patients being moved from 
the OR following a cardiac procedure may be manually resuscitated to HVCU.

ventilator at the appropriate ventilator settings as ordered by the physician.  The 
respiratory therapist will assess the patient to ensure bilateral breath sounds  and

guidelines and in accordance with infection control policies then restock.   
E. All transports under this policy must have a manual resuscitator and mask 
available throughout the transport.
