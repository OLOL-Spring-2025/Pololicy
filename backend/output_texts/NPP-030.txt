PURPOSE: 
Provide analgesia in the infant for routine procedures that produce pain. 
 
POLICY: 
Administration of Oral Sucrose for procedural pain management for the infant will adhere to the following 
guidelines. 
 
1. Sucrose solution will not be utilized in any of the following pediatric patients: 
a. Severe gastrointestinal dysfunction or abnormality (i.e., ileus, obstruction or necrotizing enterocolitis) 
b. Pancreatic dysfunction (i.e., diabetes) 
c. NPO status unless ordered by physician. 
d. Receiving paralyzing agent 
e. Cardiovascular instability 
 
2. Prepare family for procedure.  Discuss use of sucrose solution and non-nutritive sucking. 
 
3. Obtain sucrose solution and pacifier. 
 
4. Administer 2-3 drops 2 minutes before the procedure onto the anterior tip of baby’s tongue and allow to suck 
the pacifier if able.  Sucrose solution should not be administered by bottle or nasogastric tube.  The goal is 
for the sucrose solution to be absorbed by the oral mucous membrane, not swallowed. 
 
5. Allow continuous sucking on pacifier throughout the procedure. 
 
6. Assess infant’s response to sucrose administration. 
 
7. Total volume per procedure of sucrose solution administered should not exceed 2 mLs. 
 
8. For the infant who does not suck a pacifier, the sucrose solution can be administered via syringe to the 
anterior tip of the tongue in 0.2 mL increments not to exceed 2 mLs. 
 
9. If the infant is agitated or irritable despite maximum dosage for oral sucrose, additional comfort measures 
and/or analgesia are to be considered. 
 
10. Discard unused portion of sucrose solution after completion of procedure or within one hour of opening.

11. Document effectiveness. 
 
12. Repeated use should be limited to no more than 3mL/kg per 8 hours unless otherwise ordered. 
 
13. Monitor for, document, and report any adverse patient reactions to physician. 
 
 
Special considerations for the Neonate: 
1.    Eligible for use after 25 weeks corrected gestational age 
2.    Oral dose of 0.1 to 1 mL of 24% sucrose (or 0.2-0.5 mL/kg) 2 minutes before painful procedure 
3.    Document effectiveness with appropriate neonatal pain assessment tool.
