1.PURPOSE -- SCOPE
To ensure TRIMEDX medical equipment is evaluated for any/ all associated 
risks.
To ensure the maximum function of medical equipment with minimum patient 
risk.
To determine and document the appropriate Equipment Management (EM) 
Score, Alternative Equipment Maintenance (AEM) Schedule, Manufacturer 
(MFG) Schedule, and Default Maintenance Program for all 
models/descriptions in RSQ Database.
It is TRIMEDX's policy that an AEM Equipment Review will be conducted on 
TRIMEDX managed medical equipment by Quality & Regulatory and the AEM 
Equipment Review Committee. The Purpose is to determine risk factors 
associated with the items listed below and determine a corporate approved AEM 
Schedule and Default Maintenance Program.
AEquipment Risk Rating
AConsequence of Failure
AQuality & Regulatory Requirements (if applicable)
AManufacturer's Requirements/ Recommendations
AIncident and Alert/Recall History
ARepair History
Based on determination by the AEM Equipment Review Committee, each 
model/description will be assigned a Default Maintenance Program of either a 
MFG Schedule or an AEM Schedule.
Site Managers & Technicians will evaluate assigned devices and review if 
allocated Equipment Schedules address potential risk factors. (Refer to PM 
Schedule Assignment at Device Level and Request for PM Schedule Change 
Policies and Procedures).
 * Patient owned equipment is not evaluated under this process or tracked 
through the TRIMEDX RSQ Database. Refer to hospital-       specific
