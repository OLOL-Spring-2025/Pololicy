Purpose:   
To establish a standard operating procedure when administering Veletri (Epoprostenol).  To outline the 
delivery system setup and medication administration process followed by Respiratory Therapists (RT). 
 
Procedure:   
When Veletri (Epoprostenol) is ordered, the Respiratory Therapist will verify the order, identify if Veletri is 
ordered “per protocol” or not, and administer it as per order. The procedure steps below outline the process 
for setting up the delivery system, operation of the syringe pump, and set up of the AeroNeb system.   
 
1. Process for setting up of delivery system: 
1.1. Set up of the Veletri medication delivery system will include a syringe pump, Aerogen controller, 
Aerogen Solo, and Continuous nebulization tube set. 
1.2. The pharmacy will deliver two syringes to the respiratory therapist at the time of the first dose .  Each 
syringe will be received in a light protective cover.  The Respiratory Therapist will place one syringe in 
the refrigerator. 
1.3. Prior to loading medication onto  the syringe pump, the Respiratory Therapist (RT) must utilize two ID 
processes to verify patient information.  RT must also validate that the concentration is correct based 
on the patient’s ideal body weight.    
1.4. There are two concentrations of Veletri. 
1.4.1. 15,000ng/ml = 0.75 mg/50 mL 
1.4.2. 30,000ng/ml = 1.5 mg/50 mL 
1.5. The patient’s ideal body weight will determine which medication concentration should be ordered.   
1.5.1. For patients with IBW < 65kg, the concentration to be ordered and administered is 0.75mg/50mL.    
1.5.2. For patients with IBW > 65kg, the concentration to be ordered and administered is 1.5mg/50mL. 
(See addendum) 
Once the concentration and patient ID are validated, the Respiratory Therapist will assemble the 
delivery system. 
2. Set up of Syringe and tubing: (See images with steps 1 through 6 below for pictures of syringe set up) 
2.1. Aerogen syringes will be delivered from the pharmacy in a light protective bag.   
2.2. Remove the cap from the syringe.   Obtain Continuous nebulization tube set.  RT will make a hole at the 
end of the bag to connect.   To have the ability to connect the leur lock of the tubing to the end of the 
syringe – you must cut a hole in the light protective bag.  
2.3 Lift the syringe barrel clamp holder up and turn to allow for the syringe to be placed on the base of the 
pump. 
2.4 Squeeze the syringe plunger release lever to extend the syringe plunger driver.  Ensure the arm is 
extended enough to fit the entire length of the syringe.

2.5. Place the syringe on the pump and fold the light protective bag to ensure the syringe sits level on the 
pump. 
2.6. Slide the flange of the syringe into the syringe barrel flange clip.  Then, weave tubing through the tubing 
holders to ensure the tubing is not kinked. 
2.7. Squeeze the syringe plunger release lever and push it forward until it is flushed against the syringe 
plunger.  Once it is flush, release the lever.  Be sure both holders of the lever are around the syringe 
plunger. 
2.8. Lock the syringe in place by turning and lowering the syringe barrel clamp on top of the syringe; Ensure 
the clamp holds the syringe in place. 
 
              
                3.   
3. Operation of the Syringe Pump. 
3.1. Power on the syringe pump by depressing the blue power button (bottom left of the pump). 
3.2.  Select “More,” then press #2 to select “mL/HR.”  Veletri has not been created in the drug library. 
3.3. Confirm the selection of “ml/HR” by selecting “yes.” 
3.4.  Select syringe model.  Press #3 for the B-D syringe. 
3.5.  Select “confirm” after the selection of the B-D syringe. 
3.6. Enter the rate in mL/HR – enter the # of mL/HR in accordance with the protocol based on IBW, dose , 
and correct drug concentration. 
3.7.  Once #mL/HR has been verified, select “ENTER.”

3.8. Prior to initiating delivery of medication, prime the continuous neb tubing. Select the Prime/Bolus 
button with double arrows. Pressing the button once takes you to the priming screen.  Then, press and 
hold the double arrow button until the medication reaches the end of the tubing.  The maximum 
priming volume is 3.65 ml. 
3.9. Once the tubing is primed, select EXIT to return to the delivery screen.  Tubing will be connected to the 
AeroNeb once primed for delivery. 
3.10. Ensure all settings are correct, then press the green single arrow button to start the infusion pump. At 
this time, the infusing indicator lights should illuminate in a right-to-left sequence. 
 
4. Connecting tubing to AeroNeb Solo and AeroNeb Pro-X controller: 
4.1. Place the AeroNeb Solo and T -piece in the inspiratory limb on the dry side  of the heater.  Ensure that 
the medication holding chamber is upright for proper nebulization.   
4.2. Ensure that the AeroNeb Controller is plugged into  the electrical supply source  and that the control 
module cable is connected to the AeroNeb.  
4.3. Press the blue on/off button on the controller.  HOLD for at least 5 seconds to select continuous mode.  
The green light will appear to indicate Continuous on the AeroNeb control module.  (Controller MUST 
be plugged into an electrical outlet to operate in continuous mode) 
4.4. Once Continuous neb tubing is primed, the tubing will be attached to the AeroNeb.  Remove the silicone 
plug from AeroNeb and connect the leur lock of the medication tubing to the neb. The medication will 
then drip into the medication holding chamber.  
4.5. RT will label the tubing indicating the date when the tubing should be changed; tubing is validated for 
use up to 7 days. 
4.6. Every two hours, the RT will assess the patient and check that AeroNeb is nebulizing properly. RT will 
review the volume of medication left to be infused. Assessments are to ensure proper medication 
delivery and to evaluate the time for the next dose. 
4.7.  RT will place one bacteria filter in line at the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit.  
4.8.  RT will change the filter every 4 hours AND as needed. 
 
5. Changing Dose delivered: 
5.1. Veletri is ordered to be delivered to the patient at a dose in ng/kg/min.  The OLOLRMC F Veletri Dosing 
Chart will be used to determine the rate of medication delivery to deliver the desired dose in ng/kg/min 
based on patient IBW and medication concentration. The rate of medication delivery is in mL/HR.   
5.2. When the dose needs to be changed, the RT must change the rate.  To change the rate of medication 
delivery, select “CHG RATE” on the pump by pressing the rate of medication delivery, and select “CHG 
RATE” on the pump by pressing the yellow button. 
5.3. Once the correct # is entered for mL/HR, select “ENTER.”  Ensure the flashing lights are moving left to 
right, which indicates the pump is working to ensure continuous medication delivery.

6. Process and Frequency for changing medication  
6.1. The respiratory therapist will use the OLOLRMC Veletri Dosing Chart to set the rate on a pump, which 
will administer Veletri at the desired dose based on the patient's IBW. (See Dosing Chart below) 
6.2. Veletri is stable at room temperature for a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours and when covered in the 
refrigerator for eight (8) days.   
6.3. The medication syringe must be changed prior to running the medication out.   
6.4. If the patient has medication left in the syringe at four (4) hours, the syringe must be changed and 
replaced with a new syringe.  The previous syringe must be disposed of in the proper manner.   
6.5. RT will remove the syringe from the refrigerator.   
6.6. Scanning of medication: 
6.7. RT will confirm the correct  two patient IDs as well as the correct concentration prior to administering 
medication.   
6.8. RT will scan the patient's armband, then scan the patient's armband, and then scan the medication. RT 
will ensure all medication administration documentation is completed in the record prior to starting a 
new syringe.   
6.9. To change the syringe, press the RED stop button on the pump.   
6.10. Remove the used syringe from the pump and set aside to be properly disposed of.   
6.11. If medication is left in the syringe, RT should dispose of the syringe in a labeled medication box in the 
medication room. 
6.12. Press “Clear TVD ,” which is the total volume delivered. This will allow you to easily track how much 
medication has been administered to the patient over time. 
6.13. With a new syringe, ensure a small hole is cut at the end of the bag to connect the tubing with a syringe.  
The new syringe must be uncapped and then connected to the tubing.   
6.14. Load the new syringe onto the pump following the steps listed in 2.1. 
6.15. The pump screen will revert to the “select a syringe” screen. 
6.16. Select #3 for the B-D syringe.  Then select confirm to confirm the syringe type.  
6.17. There will be a question to continue at the previous setting – if you are to deliver the same dose, then 
the rate will be the same.  If so, select yes , then press the green button with the arrow to deliver 
medication. 
6.18. RT will send a medication request to the pharmacy at the time the syringe is used to ensure a dose is 
always available in the refrigerator.  
6.19. The pharmacy will deliver to the patient care unit,  and RT will ensure the medication is available in 
the refrigerator.  
 
7. Changing tubing 
7.1. Aerogen Continuous nebulization tubing has been qualified for use for a maximum of 7 days. 
7.2. Changing of tubing should be coordinated with the changing of the medication syringe.   
7.3. When tubing is changed, RT should complete the priming process as described in 3.8.

7.4. Tubing must be labeled and changed every 7 days.  RT must label the tubing , indicating the date the 
tubing is due to be changed. 
7.5. If, for any reason, the system is not functioning properly, is not able to connect to the syringe or neb, 
or the tubing is not intact, the tubing must be changed at that time.   
 
8. Documentation and charging for Veletri administration: 
8.1. The respiratory therapist will assess the  Veletri every TWO hours to verify pump and nebulizer are 
working correctly.  The assessment will include the following: 
8.2. Heart rate 
8.3. Respiratory rate 
8.4. Breath sounds 
8.5. SpO2 
8.6. Documentation of the dose of Veletri patient received at the time of the assessment.  
8.7. Review of the setup - ensure nebulization is occurring effectively. 
8.8. Review the medication amount in the syringe and the time it needs to be changed. 
8.9.  Documentation of the assessment will be completed every two hours in the patient's EMR.   
8.10. Charging for the administration of Veletri will occur for the time given.  RT will document “Continuous 
Neb 1st hour” for the first hour of medication administration. 
8.11. The RT will document “Continuous Neb Subs hour” at the time of each two-hour assessment. 
8.12. The RT will ensure that the total number of hours of use is documented prior to the end of the shift.   
8.13. Day shift will document with the 1800 vent assessment the total number of hours Veletri was 
administered for the shift, not including the 1st hour if started that day.  
8.14. The night shift will document prior to midnight and with the 0600 -vent assessment , if  Veletri is 
administered for the entire shift.  Night shift RT will document and charge 6 hours prior to midnight 
and 6 hours at 0600.
