PURPOSE: Defines qualifications of Principle Investigators (PIs) and Co-Investigators (Co-Is), and 
the general responsibilities of research personnel. 
 
SCOPE:  Applies to all PIs, Co-Is, and research personnel involved in supervising, managing, 
conducting or supporting study related activities. 
 
RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all PIs, Co-Is, and other research personnel to be 
knowledgeable about their specific research responsibilities and roles. 
 
POLICY:  
QUALIFICATIONS FOR ALL RESEARCH PERSONNEL 
 
Human Subjects Protection Training Requirements 
• PIs, Co-Is and study staff who are Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) 
employees, affiliated/contract employees or trainees, or volunteers must complete the 
appropriate Collaborative Institutional Review Board Training Initiative (CITI) modules based 
on discipline (MD, RN, Non-clinical), function and the research protocol proposed and present 
the CITI certification to the Office of Research.  The CITI web-based program must be completed 
prior to engaging in research at OLOL. The CITI REFRESHER module is required every three 
years thereafter. (See AA/OR/009). 
• Investigators who are students and not employed or contracted by, nor affiliated with OLOL 
may provide proof of Human Subjects Protection Training required by their university and 
completed within the past three (3) years in lieu of CITI training.  (See AA/OR/009). 
https://phrp.nihtraining.com/users/login.php If the student investigator does not have Human 
Subject Protection Training, training will be assigned to them to be completed prior to 
commencement of any research activities.  
•  Investigators who are not employed or contracted by, nor affiliated with OLOL must provide 
proof of Human Subjects Protection Training completed within the past three (3) years and 
deemed acceptable by the Office of Research. If Investigators do not have Human Subject 
Protection Training, training will be assigned to them and must be completed prior to 
commencement of any research activities.  
 
Regulatory Oversight Requirements 
• Off-site investigators must be provided oversight from their own IRB. 
• Investigators on any study involving more than minimal risk must be provided oversight by an 
IRB approved by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs, 
Inc. (AAHRPP).

Personnel Who Can Serve as the PI on a Research Study 
• Only individuals who are employed by OLOL or who have privileges at OLOL can serve as a PI 
on a research study. 
• Individuals with license restrictions or are on probation will not be allowed to participate in 
research endeavors. Should an investigator’s license become restricted or placed on probation 
during the conduct of a research study, the investigator will be removed from the study and 
may replaced by another investigator. If the license is reinstated or the probation lifted, the 
investigator will be allowed to resume their role on the study but will be audited for a period of 
at least three months by the Office of Research.  
• Medical students, residents, and other trainees are not eligible to act as a PI on a research study 
which is determined to be greater than minimal risk; however, these trainees may serve as Co-
Investigators or other research personnel on these types of research studies. 
 
Specimen Packaging and Shipping Training 
• All individuals who package and ship research specimens must complete training in accordance 
with Federal Regulations. Records of training (certificate and a copy of the test) will be kept by 
the Office of Research, so they are available in the event of an audit. Both the principal 
investigator and the certified individual must retain records of training.  A copy of the 
certification should be submitted to the Office of Research along with your protocol. Re-
certification is required every two years.   
 
Additional Training Requirements 
• Additional training may be required to meet the demands of particular protocols. Individuals 
involved in research conduct are responsible for identifying these needs and collaborating with 
principal investigators, their managers, and the Office of Research to design education to meet 
these needs. 
• Additional training needs may be identified due to changes introduced by regulatory bodies or 
Research Administration. Training modules will be designed, and completion made mandatory 
as necessary. 
 
PI Responsibilities 
The principal investigator (PI) is responsible for: 
• All activities associated with a research study, including responsibilities delegated to other 
research personnel. 
• Proper conduct of the study, including protecting human subjects’ rights, safety and welfare, 
protocol compliance, and adherence to institutional, state, and federal regulations and 
guidance.  
• Obtaining IRB approval of the protocol and any amendments to the protocol. 
• Ensuring that progress reports and requests for continuing review and approval are submitted 
to the IRB in accordance with the policies, procedures, and actions of the IRB of record. AA-OR-010 
Page 3 of 5 
• Providing to the IRB and to the Office of Research prompt reports of any unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others (AA/OR/008- Adverse Events and Unanticipated 
Problems) 
• Properly obtaining and documenting informed consent of subjects or their legally authorized 
representatives, unless waived by the IRB. 
• Complying with the financial and administrative policies and regulations associated with the 
award, as well as overall fiscal management of the project, if applicable. 
• Maintaining necessary regulatory and study files for each research project as required by 
federal, state, and local regulations and according to the study sponsor's contract, if applicable. 
• Participate in quality assurance activities such as monitoring visits, internal audits, sponsor 
audits, and inspections by external regulators (e.g. FDA). 
• PIs do not have the authority to enter into legal agreements involving grants, contracts and/or 
cooperative agreements on behalf of Our Lady of the Lake. These must be signed by an 
institutional approved signatory. 
• Maintaining their professional license requirements and reporting to the Office of Research 
changes regarding their license, i.e. restrictions, probation, suspension, expired.  
 
Co-I Responsibilities  
• The HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46 use the term “investigator” to refer to an individual 
performing various tasks related to the conduct of human subjects research activities, such as 
obtaining informed consent from subjects, interacting with subjects, and communicating with the 
IRB. 
• Co-Is may perform all or some of the PI functions, but do not accept primary responsibility for the 
research study. 
• Co-Is are under the supervision of the PI and are responsible for performing study–related 
procedures and /or making important study-related decisions in compliance with the ethical conduct 
of the study. 
• Conduct research in accordance with federal regulations and guidelines governing human subjects 
research as well as OLOL’s policies.  
• Participate in quality assurance activities such as monitoring visits, internal audits, sponsor 
audits, and inspections by external regulators (e.g. FDA). 
• Maintaining their professional license requirements and reporting to the Office of Research 
changes regarding their license, i.e. restrictions, probation, suspension, expired. 
 
Other Research Personnel Responsibilities  
The responsibilities for a research study may be delegated to other research personnel, such as 
research nurses, study coordinators, research assistants, regulatory coordinators, or 
administrative staff. The responsibilities delegated should be dependent upon the personnel's 
level of training and experience and in accordance with the requirements of the study.  All 
research personnel must conduct human subjects research in accordance with federal regulations 
and guidelines as well as OLOL’s policies.
