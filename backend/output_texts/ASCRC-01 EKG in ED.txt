 Purpose:   
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to be able to perform the diagnostic procedure of 
an electrocardiogram (EKG) on a patient providing immediate information, especially those patients 
presenting to the ER with chest pain, leading to appropriate treatment decisions.   
 
Procedure:   
I. Chest Pain Patient  
A. Patient presents to the ER registration desk with complaints of chest pain. The EKG should be 
completed within 10 minutes from the time of presentation.  
B. Registration desk team member will STAT message the RT (Respiratory Therapist) to the EKG 
Chest Pain Triage room or designated area, for the patient with a complaint of chest pain.  
C. A Respiratory Therapist Team member will walk the patient to the EKG Triage Room or 
designated area if bed is not readily available.  
D. Nurse or RT will enter an order for an EKG in Epic for chest pain if not already ordered. 
E. RT will scan the patient armband if applicable. 
F. RT will verify the patient’s Name and Date of Birth 
G. RT will ask the patient if he/she has a Cardiologist. 
H. RT will then place the EKG electrodes in their proper positions.  
I. RT will ensure that the EKG is cleared of artifacts.  
J. RT will print one copy of the 12-lead EKG. 
K. RT will take the copy of the 12-lead EKG to the attending ER Physician, and ER Physician will be 
told that the EKG is from a patient complaining of “chest pain” and the patient’s current 
location. 
L. The ER Physician will determine if the 12-lead EKG shows a STEMI or other life-threatening 
conditions.  
M. Once the EKG is performed. The patient will be returned to the waiting room unless the EKG 
shows a STEMI or any of the critical rhythms listed below: 
N.  
i. Acute Myocardial Infarction – possible STEMI  
ii. Heart Rate of 40 beats per minute or less for any reason 
iii. Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia 
iv. 2nd (Type II only) or 3rd degree Heart Block 
v. Atrial Fibrillation with a ventricular rate greater than 120 per minute 
vi. Supraventricular Tachycardia  
vii. Left Bundle Branch Block

O. RT will then enter Epiphany and place a note on the patient’s EKG stating that the attending 
ER Physician did or did not identify a STEMI and the time the EKG was interpreted by the ER 
Physician on the patient’s EKG note.  
 
II. All Other Patients Requiring an EKG 
A. For other patients needing an EKG, the RT will perform the procedure in the patient’s ER room, 
or if a room has not been assigned to the patient (i.e., hallway stretcher patients). 
B. Nurse or Provider will enter an order for an EKG in Epic if not already ordered. 
C. Nurse will communicate order to RT 
D. RT will scan the patient armband. 
E. RT will verify the patient’s Name and Date of Birth 
F. RT will ask the patient if he/she has a Cardiologist. 
G. RT will then place the EKG electrodes in their proper positions.  
H. RT will ensure that the EKG is cleared of artifacts.  
I. RT will then print out one copy of the 12-lead EKG. 
J. RT will take the copy of the 12-lead EKG to the attending ER Physician,  
K. The ER Physician will determine if the 12-lead EKG shows a STEMI or any of the critical rhythms 
listed below as defined by hospital policy OC/044 
L.  
i. Acute Myocardial Infarction – possible STEMI  
ii. Heart Rate of 40 beats per minute or less for any reason 
iii. Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia 
iv. 2nd (Type II only) or 3rd degree Heart Block 
v. Atrial Fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate greater than 120 per minute 
vi. Supraventricular Tachycardia  
vii. Left Bundle Branch Block 
 
M. Once the EKG is performed. The patient will be returned to the hallway or remain in their ER 
room.                
N. RT will then enter Epiphany and place a note on the patient’s EKG stating that the attending ER 
Physician did or did not identify a STEMI or critical rhythm and the time the EKG was 
interpreted by the ER Physician on the patient’s EKG note. 
III. Epiphany Follow Up 
A. After the EKG is completed, the RT will verify that the EKG has been placed in the 
“unconfirmed” status.  The EKG will then be sent to the cardiology group for interpretation in 
Epiphany.  If the patient stated a previous cardiologist, then the RT will send the EKG for

interpretation to the appropriate cardiology group.  All unassigned EKGs will be sent to the 
cardiologist group on every other day schedule rotating between LCA and BRCC.
