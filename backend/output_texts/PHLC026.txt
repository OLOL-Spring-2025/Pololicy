PURPOSE: 
To provide phlebotomy services for collection of specimens necessary for the testing of employees involved in 
Blood or Body Fluid Exposures 
 
Addresses: 
Supervisor 
Venipuncture Charge Techs 
Venipuncture Phlebotomists 
 
POLICY: 
A. For the organization’s Blood and Body Fluid Exposure process, the Venipuncture staff provide phlebotomy 
services to both the employee (including students and contract workers) and the patient to which the employee has 
been exposed through Blood or Body Fluid Exposure 
B. Venipuncture staff are to draw blood from the source patient (a patient to whom an employee was exposed) only 
after verification that the source patient’s blood is unavailable in the quantity, specimen type, or container type 
required by Chemistry for testing 
PROCEDURE: 
1. When an employee experiences a Blood and Body Fluid Exposure, the employee is to contact LakeLine Direct and 
speak with a nurse regarding the exposure.  
2. The LakeLine Direct nurse will be responsible for the ordering of the “Employee Health Exposure Panel” for the 
employee and the identified source patient.  
3. Venipuncture will receive a phone request to draw the exposed employee and the source patient. Ordered 
laboratory labels for both exposed employee and source patient will be printed to the Venipuncture Department. 
4. The Venipuncture Charge Tech is to check the computer STAT for source patient blood already in the laboratory 
and verify with Chemistry the appropriateness of the specimen for testing 
5. The employee will report to the Venipuncture Department per the direction of the LakeLine Direct nurse. A 
phlebotomist will ask the employee to complete the consent form and will collect the following specimens for the 
exposed employee: 
o One 9ml SST tube 
o One 4ml SST tube 
6. A phlebotomist is dispatched STAT to draw the following specimens for the source patient (if the sample is 
unavailable in the laboratory): 
o One 9ml SST tube
