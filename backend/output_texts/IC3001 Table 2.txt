TABLE 2 
 
Clinical Syndromes/Condition Warranting Empiric Transmission-Based Precautions In 
Addition To Standard Precautions Pending Confirmation of Diagnosis 
  
Clinical Syndrome or Condition†  Potential Pathogens‡  Empiric Precautions (Always includes Standard 
Precautions)  
DIARRHEA  
Acute diarrhea with a likely 
infectious cause in an incontinent or 
diapered patient  
Enteric pathogens§ Contact Precautions (pediatrics and adult)  
 
MENINGITIS Neisseria meningitidis  
 
 
Enteroviruses                   
 
M. tuberculosis 
Droplet Precautions for first 24 hrs of antimicrobial 
therapy; mask and face protection for intubation. 
 
Contact Precautions for infants and children.   
 
Airborne Precautions if pulmonary infiltrate. Airborne 
Precautions plus Contact Precautions if potentially 
infectious draining body fluid present. 
RASH OR EXANTHEMS, GENERALIZED, ETIOLOGY UNKNOWN  
Petechial/ecchymotic with fever 
(general) 
  
- If positive history of travel to an 
area with an ongoing outbreak of 
VHF in the 10 days before onset of 
fever  
Neisseria meningitides  
 
 
Ebola, Lassa, Marburg 
viruses 
Droplet Precautions for first 24 hours of antimicrobial 
therapy. 
 
Droplet Precautions plus Contact Precautions, with 
face/eye protection, emphasizing safety sharps and 
barrier precautions when blood exposure likely. Use 
N95 or higher respiratory protection when aerosol-
generating procedure performed. 
Vesicular  Varicella-zoster, Herpes 
simplex, Variola 
(smallpox),Vaccinia virus 
Airborne plus Contact Precautions; Contact 
Precautions only if Herpes simplex, localized zoster in 
an immunocompetent host or vaccinia viruses most 
likely 
Maculopapular with cough, coryza 
and fever  Rubeola (measles) virus Airborne Precautions  
RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS  
Cough/fever/upper lobe pulmonary 
infiltrate in an HIV-negative patient 
or a patient at low risk for human 
immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection 
M. tuberculosis, 
Respiratory viruses, S. 
pneumoniae, S. aureus 
(MSSA or MRSA) 
Airborne Precautions plus Contact Precautions  
Cough/fever/pulmonary infiltrate in 
any lung location in an HIV-infected 
patient or a patient at high risk for 
HIV infection 
 
M. tuberculosis, 
Respiratory viruses, S. 
pneumoniae, S. aureus 
(MSSA or MRSA) 
Airborne Precautions plus Contact Precautions. Use 
eye/face protection if aerosol-generating procedure 
performed or contact with respiratory secretions 
anticipated. If tuberculosis is unlikely and there are no 
AIIRs and/or respirators available, use Droplet 
Precautions instead of Airborne Precautions.  
Tuberculosis more likely in HIV-infected individual 
than in HIV negative individual 
Cough/fever/pulmonary infiltrate in 
any lung location in a patient with a 
history of recent travel (10-21 days) 
M. tuberculosis, severe 
acute respiratory 
syndrome virus (SARS-
Airborne plus Contact Precautions plus eye 
protection. 
If SARS and tuberculosis unlikely, use Droplet IC-3001- Table 2

Clinical Syndrome or Condition†  Potential Pathogens‡  Empiric Precautions (Always includes Standard 
Precautions)  
to countries with active outbreaks of 
SARS, avian influenza 
CoV), avian influenza Precautions instead of Airborne Precautions. 
Respiratory infections, particularly 
bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in 
infants and young children 
Respiratory syncytial virus, 
parainfluenza virus, 
adenovirus, influenza 
virus, Human 
metapneumovirus 
Contact Precautions and Droplet Precautions; Droplet 
Precautions may be discontinued when adenovirus 
and influenza have been ruled out 
SKIN OR WOUND INFECTION 
Abscess or draining wound that 
cannot be covered 
Staphylococcus aureus 
(MSSA or MRSA), group A 
streptococcus 
Contact Precautions 
Add Droplet Precautions for the first 24 hours of 
appropriate antimicrobial therapy if invasive Group A 
streptococcal disease is suspected 
FOOTNOTES: 
 
* Infection control professionals should modify or adapt this table according to local conditions. To ensure that appropriate 
empiric precautions are implemented always, hospitals must have systems in place to evaluate patients routinely 
according to these criteria as part of their preadmission and admission care. 
 
† Patients with the syndromes or conditions listed below may present with atypical signs or symptoms (e.g. neonates and 
adults with pertussis may not have paroxysmal or severe cough). The clinician's index of suspicion should be guided by 
the prevalence of specific conditions in the community, as well as clinical judgment.  
 
‡ The organisms listed under the column "Potential Pathogens" are not intended to represent the complete, or even most 
likely, diagnoses, but rather possible etiologic agents that require additional precautions beyond Standard Precautions 
until they can be ruled out.  
 
§ These pathogens include enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella spp, hepatitis A virus, noroviruses, 
rotavirus, C. difficile.
