Handling of Trash 
Standard Precautions will be used with handling patient trash.  There will be no isolation trash set up in 
isolation rooms, except when following the infection prevention and control practices as specified by the 
Special Communicable Disease Policy. 
 
1. Patient trash/wastes that must be placed in biohazard bags include: 
• Liquid or semiliquid blood or other potentially infectious materials 
• Contaminated items that would release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a 
liquid or semiliquid state if compressed 
• Items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable 
of releasing these materials during handling 
• Contaminated sharps (use puncture-resistant container), and 
• Pathological and microbiological waste containing blood or other potentially infectious 
material.   2 
 
2. Trash/waste that meet the above definition from patient care areas include items grossly soiled 
with infectious organisms such as purulent dressings, wound dressings containing blood, bags 
(receptacles) and tubings/filters containing blood. Contain this type of trash in a plastic bag in the 
patient room, then place into the red biohazard bin in the soiled utility room. 
 
3. The final treatments of infectious medical waste are with the following approved methods and 
parameters: 
a) Pathology waste (human tissue specimens, organs, limbs, and contaminated animal 
carcasses, parts, and specimens) is incinerated. 
b) Biohazardous waste and sharps waste are subjected to steam autoclave processing or 
incineration.  
c) Waste treatment facilities operate under and maintain compliance with local 
laws/regulations and all applicable federal, and state permits and licenses.
