PURPOSE: 
This policy outlines the process used by COPE staff to coordinate inpatient treatment for psychiatric and 
substance abuse patients at facilities available within the state of Louisiana.   
 
DEFINITIONS: 
These terms when used in this policy mean:  
1. COPE-Community Oriented Psychosocial Evaluation Team 
 
POLICY: 
 
COPE will initially speak to any patient requiring inpatient psychiatric care and attempt to ask if the 
patient has a preferred treatment facility.  
1. If the patient has a preferred facility, COPE will attempt to get placement for the patient 
in that facility however it is not guaranteed due to availability of beds at each facility.  
2. If the patient does not have a preferred facility, it is the policy of COPE to make an initial 
search for patientâ€™s requiring inpatient psychiatric within 50 miles of Our Lady of the 
Lake Regional Medical Center. If a patient has not been accepted in the local area within 
30 minutes of the initial request for placement, COPE may seek placement outside of the 
50-mile radius.  
 
All efforts will be made to keep the patient within his or her local area in order to assist in the 
facilitation of their after-care or follow-up care programming and to allow for participation of their 
family in treatment and family meetings while hospitalized.
