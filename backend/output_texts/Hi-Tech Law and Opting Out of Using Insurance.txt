PURPOSE:    
To define how the HITECH law impacts patient registrations.  To define what steps registrars are 
to take when a patient requests to opt-out of using his/her health insurance. 
 
 
POLICY: 
Under the final HITECH rule, when patients pay out of pocket in full, they can instruct their 
provider to refrain from sharing information about their treatment with their health plan 
 
The patient has the right to not have his/her claim filed to his/her health insurance, provided 
that he/she pays for the services out of pocket, in full, at the time of service.  
 
PROCEDURE: 
If the patient “opts out” and decides not to bill his/her health insurance for whatever reason, the 
registrar will do the following: 
1. Register the patient as “Private Pay” – The patient is responsible for payment in 
FULL WITHOUT DISCOUNT.  The registrar will run PPE and remove the 
discount by entering “0” under the private pay discount and recalculate. AGAIN – 
the patient MUST pay in FULL prior to services being rendered.  
2. If patient cannot pay in FULL – The registrar will enter the patient’s health insurance 
into the registration software and collect copay/deductible/co-insurance. 
3. Click “do not bill insurance” in EPIC. 
4. Notify the Business Office that the patient has opted out.   
• Ask the Business Office to put the patient’s account on hold so that other 
insurance is not added.   
• Ask the Business office to add notes in the billing system to indicate that 
this is an “opt-out” patient.
