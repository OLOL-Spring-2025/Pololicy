SCOPE: 
Applies to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Inc. (“OLOL”) and its wholly owned sponsored organizations (collectively 
referred to herein as “Entity”) that propose and adopt Facility wide policies. 
PURPOSE: 
According to Catholic moral principles, all human life is sacred from conception to death; euthanasia, or the 
affirmative and deliberate act or deliberate omission to end life, is prohibited at Our Lady of the Lake Regional 
Medical Center.  (Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, Sixth Edition - #60.) 
 
POLICY: 
A. A decision to permit the natural process of dying, when this is for the benefit of the patient, is not 
euthanasia.  (See Philosophy & General Guidelines for Making Decisions Concerning Life-Sustaining 
Procedures – OrgOps/ET/007 NPC 147) 
B. Medicines to alleviate or suppress pain may be given to a dying person, even if this may indirectly shorten 
the person’s life so long as the intent is not to hasten death.  (Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic 
Health Services, Sixth Edition #61)
