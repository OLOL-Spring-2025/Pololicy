PURPOSE: 
 
To standardize a product selection procedure for acetaminophen dosing in pediatric patients. 
 
POLICY: 
 
Acetaminophen is widely used in children.  Even though safety and efficacy is well established, toxicity 
remains a concern.  The availability of multiple formulations leads to confusion among caregivers and 
unintentional overdoses in pediatric patients.  Rectal suppositories cannot reliably be divided by more 
than half.  The physician order will select the appropriate acetaminophen formulation at the point of order 
entry.  
 
A. Oral liquid product selection: 
 
 Acetaminophen doses for all pediatric patients requiring liquid preparation will be entered and 
dispensed using the acetaminophen 325mg/10.15ml unit dose suspension.   
 
B. Rectal suppository product selection:  
 
Orders for acetaminophen rectal suppositories will be rounded according to the table below.  The 
pharmacist verifying the order will make the appropriate rounding step.
