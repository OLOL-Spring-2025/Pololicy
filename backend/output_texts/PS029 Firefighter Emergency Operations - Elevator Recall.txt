Title: Firefighter Emergency Operations 
(Elevator Recall)  
Revision Date:  
Review Date: 09/30/2021 
Reference # PS029 Origin Date: March 2018 
 
PURPOSE: 
To provide a safe physical environment for patients, staff and visitors at all Our Lady of the Lake 
Regional Medical Center (OLOL) network locations. 
 
POLICY: 
Firefighter Emergency Operations (FEO) are required in all existing elevators having a travel distance of 
25 feet or more.  The elevator recall initiating devices are part of the fire alarm system.  This system 
notifies the occupants and the fire department of alarm conditions. 
 
The FEO removes control and accessibility of the elevator cabs from the public and gives it to the 
firefighters.  This provides the firefighters another tool to fight the fire and prevents the public from the 
possibility of getting trapped in the elevator. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
All elevators provided with firefighters’ emergency operation inspected monthly as required by ASME 
A17.1/CSA B44 with Phase I recall by use of the key switch and a minimum of one-floor operation on 
Phase II. 
 
Phase I Emergency Recall Operation is the operation of an elevator where it is automatically or 
manually recalled to the recall level and removed from normal service because of activation of 
firefighters’ emergency operation. 
 
Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation is the operation of an elevator by firefighters where the elevator 
is under their control. 
 
Maintenance records shall include, at a minimum, the maintenance task and date performed including a 
written record of the findings on the firefighter’s service operation required by ASME A17.1-2007/CSA 
B44-07, 8.6.11.1.
