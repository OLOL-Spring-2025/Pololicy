POLICY: 
OLOL provides a Chapel for the use of patients and families, visitors and employees. 
 
PROCEDURE:

daily. 
 
2. Mass will be celebrated in the Hospital Chapel daily, in the absence of a Priest, a Communion 
Service will be held.  
 
3. The Chapel is designed primarily for Catholic Services, however, services of other denominations or 
celebrations of other groups may be held in the chapel with prior approval by the Pastoral Care 
Director or a member of Senior Management. 
 
4. Religious services are televised on Channel 43 and are available to the patients in their rooms.
