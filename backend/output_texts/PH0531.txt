1. Overview and Scope 
1.1 This policy serves as the written Sterile Compounding Training and Evaluation Program for 
FMOLHS Baton Rouge Market Pharmacies and describes the procedures for training and 
evaluating sterile practice knowledge and competencies of personnel involved in or having direct 
oversight of compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).   
Refer to Appendix One for a summary of the Sterile Training and Competency Program. 
1.2 The Sterile Compounding Training & Competency Program equips compounding personnel with 
the didactic knowledge and practical training in the foundational principles of sterile 
compounding. Competency evaluations validate proficiency in the required skills necessary to 
perform related job functions and maintain the quality of the sterile environment.  The Program 
consists of initial and ongoing training and evaluation in the following areas: 
Sterile Compounding Core Competencies and Principles Knowledge  - demonstrates 
Compounding Personnel possess the knowledge of and proficiency in the skills necessary to 
perform sterile manipulations and achieve and maintain appropriate environmental 
conditions. 
Hand Hygiene and Garbing Competency (including Gloved Fingertip and Thumb Sampling)  - 
ensures Compounding Personnel can safely and effectively complete hand hygiene, garbing, 
and donning of gloves without touch contamination. 
Aseptic Manipulation Competency (including Media Fill)  - validates Compounding Personnel 
aseptic technique and related manipulations within an ISO 5 compounding environment. 
     1.3    The USP Expert Committee has recognized an effective sterile compounding practice involves 
       personnel, vendors, and other visitors that are not directly compounding or performing 
  compounding related activities.  Consequently, training and evaluation requirements are 
defined based on role and potential risk for contaminating the sterile compounding areas.   
Compounding Personnel  – individuals performing or directly overseeing compounding 
activities as well as the Designated Person(s) 
Inventory and Cleaning Personnel – individuals performing restocking or cleaning and 
disinfecting activities and that do not directly or indirectly participate in compounding CSPs 
In-Process & Final Verification Personnel  – typically pharmacists, who do not participate in 
compounding or the oversight of compounding activities 
Other Personnel & Visitors – individuals who have a need to enter compounding areas (under 
supervision) but do not participate in or support the compounding activities in any way 1.4 When performing aseptic manipulations according to the related USP standards and training 
and qualification requirements, personnel compounding the following types of sterile 
compounds are exempt from this policy: 
• Licensed allergenic extracts 
• Blood-derived and other biological materials 
• Sterile radiopharmaceuticals 
• Immediate-use compounds 
• Sterile drug preparation per approved manufacturer’s labeling 
• Proprietary bag and vial systems docked and activated for immediate administration to a 
single patient 
1.5 This policy applies to compounding of only non-hazardous CSPs. Refer to USP <800>  for 
additional training and competency assessment requirements for hazardous drug 
Compounding.   
 
2. Policy  
2.1. Compounding and supporting personnel successfully complete training and demonstrate 
knowledge of and proficiency in all of the skills and competencies necessary maintain the quality 
of the compounding environment and perform job -related functions before compounding CSPs,

of personnel performing compounding related activities 
6.3 Compounding personnel and supporting roles:   
Successfully complete assigned training and demonstrate proficiency via competency 
assessment on a timely basis and before the evaluation activities are past due. 
Uphold sterile practice and quality standards to help ensure the quality of the sterile 
compounding area. 
7. Procedures  
7.1 Sterile Compounding Knowledge, Skills and Core Competency Assessment 
DP or AT directly observes Compounding Personnel performing the Core Competencies and 
Skills (refer to Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and records results electronically in SoleSource® Simplifi 
797®.  Core competency evaluation can be completed in a single or multiple observed sessions. If the 
process is completed in separate sessions, documentation reflects the date, time, and 
initials of the DP or AT performing and evaluating the specific competencies. 
Competencies for hand hygiene, garbing, and aseptic technique can be conducted concurrently 
with the respective competency assessment.  Observations and evaluations of each 
competency are clearly documented on the respective competency form.  
7.2 Documentation of the Hand Hygiene and Garbing and Aseptic Manipulation Competencies 
includes, at a minimum: 
Name of person evaluated 
Evaluation date and time 
Media and component manufacturer, lot, and expiration date  
Incubation temperatures 
Dates of Incubation 
Competency results 
Name of competency observer and individual(s) reading and documenting results 
Corrective actions (if needed) 
7.3 Garbing Competency and Gloved Fingertip and Thumb Sampling Assessment Procedure 
Remove sampling plates (or alternative sampling device) from refrigerator in manufacturer’s 
overwrap and check expiration dates; do not use expired media.  
Collect other supplies needed,  disinfect with sIPA,  and move supplies to controlled 
environment.   
Allow sampling plates to come to room temperature just prior to sampling.   
Enter media lot numbers, expiration dates, and manufacturer on the F-402.a1 Gloved Fingertip 
Sampling Log.  DP or AT labels the base (i.e. agar side) of the sampling plates legibly around 
the outer edge (or permanently affixed lid on slide or paddle). Label each sample plate with 
sample type (e.g. “GFS”), hand (e.g., “L” -left or “R” - right), sample number (e.g., 1, 2, or 3) 
for initial competency, date, and initials of individual.   
Complete hand hygiene and garbing under direct observation.  See Policy 2.2 Hand Hygiene and 
Garbing.   
          GFS – LAFW, BSC, or IVFLZ: 
Don sterile gloves but do NOT apply sIPA to gloved hands.   
DP or AT sanitizes sterile gloves with sIPA, removes the lid of a labeled sampling plate, and holds 
vertically.  
Compounding personnel gently rolls the pad of each finger, one at a time, in an arch across the 
top of the agar surface ensuring not to overlap fingerprints.  A thumb print is then gently 
placed in the middle of the plate. 
The lid is immediately replaced, and the sample is set to the side.  
Repeat sampling process for the second hand; ensure the correctly labeled plate is used. 
Immediately, after both hands have been sampled and without touching any surfaces, complete 
the garb doffing process. 
During the Initial GFT competency assessment, repeat the entire process two subsequent times.  
After all samples are collected, seal plates with wax or tape to ensure the lid is not dislodged 
during transit, incubation, or results inspection. 
7.4 Aseptic Manipulation Competency Procedure (including Media Fill and Post Media Fill Gloved 
Fingertip and Surface Sampling) 
Collect supplies needed for the media fill testing, post media fill GFS (2 plates per media fill test), 
and surface sampling (1 plate per media fill test)   When more than one media fill test is to be completed, ensure all necessary media, supplies, 
and sampling plates for each media fill are collected and organized prior to initiating 
assessment. 
Check all growth media components for expiration date. Do not use expired media. Allow 
sampling plates to come to room temperature just prior to sampling.   
Inspect all sterile media fill components for cracks, leaks, or other potential factors that may 
have compromised product’s sterility.  Do not use media suspected of contamination or 
sterile container defects.  
Disinfect all media and supplies with sIPA, and move supplies to controlled environment. 
Enter media lot numbers, expiration dates, and manufacturers on the F-402.a2 Media Fill Log.   
When more than one media fill test is to be completed, record each media fill on a separate 
competency form.   
DP or AT labels the base (i.e. agar side) of the sampling plates legibly around the outer edge (or 
permanently affixed lid on slide or paddle) and the final dosage unit(s) for the media fill test. 
Label each sample with sample type (e.g., “MF”, “PMF-GFS”, or “SS”), hand (e.g., “L” -left or 
“R” - right), date, and initials of individual.   
Stage all media and supplies within reach of Primary Engineering Control (PEC).   
Disinfect gloved hands and all components with sIPA prior to being moved into the ISO Class 5 
area of the PEC. 
Perform media fill under direct observation per procedure detailed in Appendix 3: Media Fill 
Procedures.   
sIPA is used throughout the media fill process to sanitize sterile gloves, critical sites, and the 
direct compounding area; however, do not apply sIPA to gloved hands or the DCA after the 
final step of the media fill procedure. 
Sterile media components are manipulated in a manner that simulates typical sterile-to-sterile 
compounding activities and the sterile soybean casein digest media is transferred into 
containers similar to those typically used. Soybean casein digest media is  not diluted with 
water or another diluent unless specified by the manufacturer. 
Immediately following the final step of the media fill procedure and before sIPA is applied to 
gloved hands or the DCA: 
DP or AT performs the post media fill GFS (PMF -GFS) and DCA surface sample inside the ISO 
5 PEC.  GFS sampling is performed for both hands with one plate per hand.  Refer to the GFS 
sampling procedures above in 4.1. 
After all samples are collected and removed from the PEC, seal plates around outer edges with 
wax or tape to ensure the lid is not dislodged during transit or incubation and results 
inspection. 
Remove all other trash from the PEC and clean and disinfect PEC prior to commencing 
compounding. 
Remove and replace sterile gloves immediately without touching any other surfaces; gloves are 
contaminated with growth medium.  Repeat hand hygiene and garbing prior to returning to 
compounding activities.  
 
7.5 Selection, Incubation, & Interpretation of Media 
Media Selection: 
Select a general microbial growth agar (plate, paddle, or slide) supporting both bacterial and 
fungal growth, such as trypticase soy agar (TSA), for gloved fingertip and surface sampling. Growth 
medium contains additives that neutralize residual cleaning solutions, such as lecithin and 
polysorbate 80. For media fill procedures, replace all CSP components with soybean –casein digest media 
components.  
Obtain a Certificate of Analysis (COA) from the growth media supplier or manufacturer. The DP 
reviews and retains the COA to ensure the culture media supports growth of microorganisms 
(as defined in Table 1 of USP <71>).  Store media per manufacturer instr uctions and media is 
used in accordance with manufacturer instructions and before the expiration date of the media. 
 
Media Incubation & Interpretation: 
Locate calibrated incubators monitored by NIST certified temperature gauge outside of the 
sterile compounding area.  A minimum of two incubators are available: 
Incubator 1: calibrated and maintained at 30 to 35°C 
Incubator 2: calibrated and maintained at 20 to 25°C 
Invert gloved fingertip and surface sample agar plates during incubation to ensure moisture 
condensation does not collect and fall onto the agar surface which can contaminate and/or 
invalidate the results.

Only the DP, AT or their designee who is qualified to manage, read, and interpret media places 
or moves media into and out of incubators.   
Record date, time, incubator temperature, and person(s) moving media into and between 
incubators on competency form(s). 
Read and record CFU counts per sampling plate and examine media fill bags/units for visible 
changes daily or, at a minimum, when media are moved from the first to the second 
incubator.  Record interim results on competency form(s). 
Read and record CFU counts per sampling plate at the conclusion of the full incubation; total 
CFU counts from all plates to determine the final CFU count results.  Record results on the 
competency form(s). 
Examine the media fill bag/units for any visible turbidity or changes indicating growth at the 
conclusion of the full incubation against a white and black background in a well -lit area, 
record either a pass or failed result on the Media Fill form. 
7.6 Corrective Action for Competency Failure   
Any personnel failing to demonstrate competency during a foundational knowledge exam or 
hands-on skills assessment is coached and reinstructed on the applicable policy, technique(s), 
and foundational knowledge related to the skill;  and subsequently re -evaluated by the DP or 
AT.    Evaluation and corrective action for observed competencies is documented within the 
competency form.  Corrective action records are used for long -term assessment of personnel 
competency and potential contributing factors to maintaining a state of microbial control within 
the sterile compounding environment.  
7.7 Extended Absence or Frequency of Compounding   
If personnel are not actively engaged in CSP activities for 12 months or more, initial training and 
competency is assigned upon their return.    
Initial training and competency assessments are completed before re-entry to CSP activities and 
compounding independently.  
Ongoing Training   
The DP is responsible for assessing the training needs of personnel and the appropriate method 
for communication and delivery as new or updated equipment, components, recipes, or 
procedures are introduced.    
Ongoing training may be communicated in a staff meeting, huddle or email.   
Ongoing training will be documented in Healthstream or SoleSource® Simplifi 797®.   
  
 
 
7.8  Monitoring of Compounding Activities   
The DP conducts quarterly tracer observations of CSP personnel and processes.    
If deficient practices are observed, the DP discusses the following with the personnel:   
Identify the issue(s) observed.  
Review and reinstruct on the expected practice.  
Confirm understanding with a return demonstration or teach back method.
