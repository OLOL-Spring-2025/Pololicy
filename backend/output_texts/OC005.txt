POLICY NUMBER:  
OC 005 
 
SCOPE: 
Applies to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Inc. (“OLOL”) and its wholly owned sponsored organizations (collectively 
referred to herein as “Entity”) that propose and adopt Facility wide policies. 
PURPOSE: 
To provide guidelines for effectively communicating with sensory impaired patients. 
POLICY: 
• Patients have a right to auxiliary communication modalities that accommodate their special communication 
needs in order to have effective communication.   
• Identification of sensory-impaired patients should take place, when reasonably possible, at the first access point 
within the hospital.  This information will be communicated as needed to care providers. 
• The nursing admission assessment identifies sensory-impaired patients and if auxiliary communication 
modalities may be needed.   
• The type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to ensure effective communication will vary in accordance with 
the method of communication used by the individual; the nature, length, and complexity of the communication 
involved; and the context in which the communication is taking place. 
• Interpreter services, through Video Remote Interpretation (VRI) or in person, will be provided in circumstances 
where there will be discussion of complex diagnostic or treatment information.   
• The use of auxiliary communication modalities will be done at no cost to the sensory-impaired patient. 
• Sensory impaired patients will be placed in a room near the nurse’s station whenever possible.  
• Notice of sensory impairment will be posted on the “white board” in the patient’s room and the nurse call system 
at the nurse’s station.

DEFINITIONS: 
• Sensory-Impaired patients: any patient who may be: 1) profoundly hearing impaired, deaf, or hard of hearing, 
2) unable to speak or speak clearly enough to be understood, or 3) have vision impairments.  These patients may 
require alternative means of communication assistance such as lip reading, the use of auxiliary aids or other 
communication services including the use of an American Sign Language interpreter through VRI or in person. 
• Complex diagnostic or treatment information may, depending on the patients’ health needs, include but is not 
limited to: 
o Obtaining a history and physical 
o Explanation of a diagnosis and plan of treatment/care 
o During procedures where on-going communication with a patient is required to monitor and effectively 
administer the procedure 
o Discharge teaching and planning 
o Complex patient education 
o Legal issues (Advance Directives, Do Not Resuscitate) 
o Explaining the risks, benefits and alternative to procedures/treatment (informed consent) 
o Psychiatric evaluations 
o Making or processing a complaint. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
Caring for Hearing Impaired Patients 
• The health care provider will determine the level of auxiliary communication aids necessary considering factors 
such as nature, length and complexity of communication and patient communication abilities. 
• The following devices are readily available to assist patients who are hearing impaired: 
o Video remote interpretation (Interpreter on Wheels) 
o Charts with key pictures and words 
o A dry erase board and marker 
o Paper and pen  
• When the clinical team determines that an in person ASL interpreter is needed, the unit will contact the patient’s 
preferred hospital approved interpreter service. (This list is available on TeamLink at General Information / 
Communication Resources / Approved interpreter Agencies.  If difficulty is encountered after hours, Patient 
Care Services is available for assistance. 
• In emergent situations, treatment will be provided in accordance with standard medical practice.  Friends or 
relatives of an individual who is hearing impaired may be used to interpret only until other effective means of 
communication are available.  Treatment will not be delayed pending arrival of other effective means of 
communication. 
• Friends or relatives of an individual who is hearing impaired should not be used for interpreting purposes except 
when the patient specifically requests that the accompanying adult interpret or facilitate communication, the  
OrgClin/005 Care of Sensory (Hearing, Speech, Visually) Impaired Patients  
3 
accompanying adult agrees to provide such assistance, and reliance on that adult for such assistance is 
appropriate under the circumstances.  We should always utilize the interpreter on wheels to ensure accurate 
effective communication. 
• If the patient declines the use of any hospital provided auxiliary communication modalities, this should be 
documented in the medical record.   
• Please review Guidelines for Communicating with the Hearing-Impaired Patient (Appendix A). 
Caring for Speech Impaired Patients 
• Speech impairments may be caused by a variety of factors, including brain injury, drug abuse, hearing loss, 
intellectual disability, neurological disorders, physical impairments (including such conditions as cleft lip or 
palate) and even physical and verbal abuse.  Speech impairments can significantly limit the ability to 
communicate.  For some patients this happens suddenly and unexpectedly which may result in strong feelings of 
frustration, anger, shame, and isolation.  The person may withdraw. 
• Please review Guidelines for Communicating with the Speech Impaired Patient (Appendix B). 
Caring for Visually Impaired Patients 
• If the patient has a visual impairment to such a degree that they are unable to read and understand documents 
they need to sign, a staff person or a member of the patient’s family may be used to read all documents aloud.   
• Service animals that accompany sight impaired patients are permitted according to the Animal Visitation and Pet 
Therapy Policy (IC 2001).  
• Please review Guidelines for Communicating with the Visually Impaired Patient (Appendix C).

Appendix A: Guidelines for Communicating with the Hearing-Impaired Patient 
• Face the patient directly – Preferably on the same level and make eye contact.  
• Know where to position yourself – If the patient hears better in one ear than the other, stand on 
that side of the patient two to three feet away.  
• Use Good Lighting – Position yourself so light is shining on your face, not in the eyes of the 
patient.  
•  Say the person's name before beginning a conversation – This gives the listener a chance to 
focus attention and reduces the chance of missing words at the beginning of the conversation.  
• Speak clearly at a moderate pace without shouting or exaggerating mouth movements – 
Slow down a little, pause between sentences or phrases, and wait to make sure you have been 
understood before going on. Enunciate words carefully and avoid mumbling.  
• Do not shout – Shouting distorts the sound of speech and may make lip reading more difficult.   
• Do not speak directly into the patient’s ear – This prevents the patient from using visual clues. 
• Keep your hands away from your face while talking – If you are eating, chewing, smoking, 
etc. while talking, your speech will be more difficult to understand. Beards and moustaches can 
also interfere with the ability of the hearing impaired to speech read.  
• Avoid noisy backgrounds – Conversations are difficult to hear when there is background noise.  
Whenever possible, close the door to the patient’s room and position the patient so their back is to 
a wall. 
• Take turns speaking – Only one person should speak at a time.  Allow adequate time for the 
patient to listen and respond. 
• Communicate pertinent information in writing 
• Give clues when changing subjects – Avoid sudden changes of topic. If the subject is changed, 
tell the hearing-impaired person what you are talking about now. It allows the patient to become 
ready for a new topic. 
• Use longer phrases – Longer phrases tend to be easier to understand and give more meaning than 
shorter phrases. 
• Keep it simple – Put terms in plain English, avoid slang or medical jargon. 
• Remember that everyone, especially the hard-of-hearing, have a harder time hearing and 
understanding when ill or tired.

Appendix B: Guidelines for Communicating with the Speech Impaired Patient  
▪ Gain attention - Make sure you have the patient’s attention before communicating. Stand in the 
patient’s line of sight. Be aware that patients may have a visual deficit on the affected side. 
▪ Don’t rush – Give the patient time to speak and to find the right words. Be patient. Do not 
interrupt. Give at least 30 seconds to respond (try to look relaxed while waiting). Pause frequently 
in the conversation to allow the patient time to process the information. 
▪ Acknowledge competence – Speak to the patient in age appropriate language. Don’t assume the 
patient cannot understand. Explaining what is happening and providing assurance can be helpful.   
▪ Control the environment – Competing sounds can make it harder to communicate. Avoid 
background noise and other distractions (i.e. TV, radio, other conversations, etc.) 
▪ Keep it simple – Speak slowly and clearly, using short and simple sentences. Do not bombard the 
patient with excessive questions. Place stress on the important words in sentences. Use simple, 
specific yes/no questions or fixed choice questions (i.e. Do you want milk or juice?) 
▪ Double check – Confirm that the patient understands what “yes” and “no” mean, then double 
check important points in the conversation by asking yes or no questions. Observing the person’s 
facial expression, eye gaze, body posture or gestures to determine level of comprehension. 
▪ Try other methods – Look for other, visual ways to communicate (i.e. writing, gestures, 
pointing, facial expressions, drawing, picture board, ABC board, using other descriptive words, 
etc.). The important thing is to get the point across. Don’t worry about correct grammar or 
sentence structure. 
▪ Repeat – Repeating information can be beneficial. Review important information again as 
needed. Summarize information during and after the conversation. 
▪ Verify – Be honest with the patient. Let them know if you cannot understand. Restate what you 
think was said to ensure the message was accurate. If after 2-3 times you still cannot understand, 
ask the patient to take a break and try again in a few minutes. 
▪ Be understanding – Be aware that the patient may have feelings of frustration, anger, 
depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and confusion. The patient’s communication abilities may 
vary day to day or morning to evening due to fatigue or stress.

Appendix C: Guidelines for Communicating with the Visually Impaired Patient 
• Alert the patient to your presence – Knock on the door and enter the room addressing your 
patient by name every time you enter the room.  Tell the patient your name and title and introduce 
anyone who may be with you. Tell the patient when you are leaving the room; let him/her know if 
others will remain in the room or if he/she will be alone. 
• Use whatever vision remains and treat as a sighted person as much as possible. 
• Communicating with the patient – Always explain what you are going to do in detail before 
doing it.  Speak to the patient directly in an age appropriate manner.  Do not raise your voice.  
Avoid nonverbal responses; remember body language may be unseen. 
• Provide patient access to needed items – Place needed items (phone, call bell, tissue) on the 
bedside table within easy reach and describe their location to the patient.  When appropriate place 
the item(s) in the patient’s hand.   
• Offer assistance – Ask how you may help.  Only assist if the blind person asks for it.  
• Provide a safe environment – Describe the layout of the room and tell the patient where the 
bathroom is and ensure walkways are free of clutter.  Keep the room well-lit and use a night light 
at night 
• Orient the patient frequently – Use the clock’s coordinates to describe the location of food on 
the plate.  
• Encourage the family to bring talking clock/watch, radio, and books from home. 
• When ambulating with a patient – Don't grab their arm … allow them to take your arm by 
grasping gently at your elbow 
• Service dogs – If a service dog is present, do not feed or pet the dog without permission 
• Patient Education – Provide all patient education and discharge information verbally; read any 
written material to the patient.

Appendix D: Guidelines for Communicating Effectively Through an Interpreter 
When working with an interpreter, you should assess verbal and nonverbal indicators to gauge how well 
the message is being understood and the patient/family/representative’s comfort level.  
• Addressing the Patient – Address the patient directly, using first- and second- person 
terminology (“I” and “you”). In general, it is best to look directly at the patient when speaking to the 
patient. When the patient is responding, you should make eye contact as well. It is acceptable to look 
at the interpreter when he or she is conveying the patient’s statements.  
• Use of Language - Avoid slang terminology.  Many local words and phrases may not translate 
accurately into other languages. Avoid the use healthcare jargon. Simple language, short, precise 
questions and sentences work best.  
• Rate of Speech - Speak slowly and clearly rather than more loudly. Gauge the pace at which the 
interpreter can convey messages back and forth. Ask the interpreter at the beginning of the interview 
to inform you at any time if the conversation is proceeding too quickly. Provide the interpreter time 
to convey what has been said.  
• Interpretation – Make and initial request that everything said by the patient/family/representative 
and the healthcare provider is interpreted.  
• Acknowledge Beliefs - Encourage the interpreter to ask questions and to alert the healthcare 
provider about potential cultural misunderstandings that may arise. If the patient offers views or 
ideas counter to best practice, or safe care, acknowledge what is being said and attempt to work 
within the patient’s understanding without jeopardizing the message that needs to be conveyed.  
• Avoid patronizing or infantilizing the patient. A lack of or poor English language skills are not a 
reflection of low cognitive function or a lack of education.  
• Assess Patient Understanding - Ask the patient to repeat back important information to 
ensure it was understood.  At the end of the interaction, review the material with the patient to ensure 
nothing has been missed or misunderstood. Ask the patient/family/representative to demonstrate a 
skill when appropriate.  Ask if the patient/family/representative has any questions.  
• Be patient with yourself and the patient/family/representative. Providing care across a language 
barrier takes time. Communication through an interpreter requires more time than a non-interpreted 
interview.  Plan accordingly.
