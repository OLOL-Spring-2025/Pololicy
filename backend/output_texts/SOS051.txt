Areas

PURPOSE: 
To establish guidelines for the perioperative process on safe and effective use of medical 
equipment in the operating room (OR) and procedural areas. 
POLICY: 
1. Equipment Verification: 
All medical equipment must be verified for functionality and cleanliness before each use in 
the operating room. This includes inspecting all electrical equipment, including loaned 
equipment, for signs of wear (e.g., frayed cords, strain relief) and damage before each use. 
2. Extension Cord Usage: 
When using an extension cord, ensure it is the proper length and plug it directly into a 
power source. Under no circumstances should extension cords be connected to another 
extension cord or a relocatable power tap (RPT) to another RPT. 
3. Consultation with Biomedical Engineers: 
Consult with biomedical engineers when introducing any new equipment or to predetermine 
which equipment can be safely accommodated by the portable outlet, ensuring 
compatibility and safety standards are met. 
4. Alarm Verification: 
Verify that clinical and alert alarms are audible before beginning procedures. No audible 
alarms should be turned off without proper consultation and documentation. Any changes to 
clinical alarm settings (e.g., high or low limits) must be communicated to all relevant team 
members. 
5. Cord Management: 
Arrange cords in a manner that prevents damage and minimizes trip and fall hazards. All 
cords should be secured and organized to maintain a safe operating environment. 
6. Training and Use: 
Only trained and authorized personnel are permitted to operate medical equipment in the 
OR. Staff must complete all required training sessions and demonstrate competency before 
being allowed to use specific devices. All devices must be used in accordance to the 
manufacturers IFU or other such recommendations that ensure safe patient outcomes.   2 
7. Cleaning and Disinfection: 
Strict adherence to infection control protocols is required when using medical equipment. 
This includes using sterile covers, proper cleaning, and disinfection of reusable equipment, 
as well as the disposal of single-use items according to hospital policy. All items shall be 
disinfected with hospital approved products according to the manufacture’s specifications,  
8. Maintenance and Calibration: 
Regular maintenance and calibration of all medical equipment must be performed according 
to established schedules by biomed. Part of the “before each use” inspection will consist of 
reviewing any PM stickers or other expiration dates. Staff should report any concerns 
regarding equipment performance to the biomedical engineering department promptly. 
9. Tagging, Removing, and Reporting Defective Devices: 
Any medical equipment identified as defective, or malfunctioning must be immediately 
tagged with a “Red Maintenance Repair Tag” to prevent its usage. Note the problem on the 
tag.  
Any supply attached or connected to the device is identified as defective, or malfunctioning 
must be immediately sequestered and logged for review. If necessary, contact risk and the 
device manufacturer. 
Remove the defective device from the OR. Report it to the appropriate supervisor. Start a 
service work order with biomedical engineering department for further evaluation and 
repair. 
 
Red Maintenance Repair Tag  
 
*A yellow tag indicates repairs are in progress.  
*The green tag indicated that the repairs were complete.

10. Incident Reporting: 
Follow the same process for defective devices along with isolating any device involved in 
the incident.  
Any incidents involving equipment malfunction, adverse events, or near misses must be 
reported through the hospital’s incident reporting system. Include details of the defect and 
any potential patient safety concerns. An investigation, as warranted, will be conducted to 
determine the cause and prevent future occurrences. 
11. Records: 
A log of all medical equipment used in each patient procedure must be maintained in the 
EMR. The CEID number will be used to track the device. Other pertinent information to 
document might include: the type of equipment, operator names, and any issues 
encountered during the procedure.
