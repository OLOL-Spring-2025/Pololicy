Purpose: 
 
To ensure that charge master pricing is performed in a compliant and consistent manner. 
 
Policy: 
 
It is the policy of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center to centralize the review 
and maintenance of the Charge Description Master File.  It is the policy of this hospital to 
maintain a standard of consistency and accuracy in the estimation of cost and 
establishment of charges.  This practice allows Our Lady of the Lake to ensure 
uniformity in pricing across departments and compliance with state and federal 
regulations.  The practice of setting prices takes into consideration several sources of 
information and additionally allows for Administrative override.  The sources for price 
determination include market price information, benchmarks, and review to conclude that 
reimbursement does not fall below cost.  Revenue Management has the responsibility of 
setting prices with over-sight by the Controller.         
 
                 
I       TO DETERMINE THE CHARGE FOR A SUPPLY/IMPLANT ONLY: 
 
To calculate the charge for a supply/implant, use the cost obtained from Materials 
Management, add tax, and mark up by the correct percentage; these markups 
include a 40% overhead allowance: 
 
- Item cost is $0.00 - $25.00, multiply by 2.50  (150% mark-up) 
- Item cost is $25.01 - $100.00, multiply by 2.30  (130% mark-up)  
- Item cost is $100.01 - $250.00, multiply by 2.00  ( 100% mark-up)  
- Item cost is greater than $250.01 multiply by 1.80 ( 80% mark-up) 
- Items that are charge sensitive will be reviewed under the applicable                 
reimbursement guidelines.  
 
 Round the result to the nearest dollar.   
 
 
 
 
  
II      TO DETERMINE THE HOURLY CHARGE FOR PERSONNEL ONLY: 
 
1. To calculate the cost for personnel, use the average hourly salary for the 
employee class being utilized, and multiply that hourly charge by 1.3 
(includes the cost of benefits); the result is the total employee cost per 
hour.  To calculate the total hourly charge for personnel, multiple the total 
employee cost by 2.0 (includes support overhead).   
 
 
III     TO CALCULATE MACHINE CHARGE PER PROCEDURE: 
 
1. To calculate the machine charge per procedure, obtain the actual cost of 
the machine.  Add to this number the sales tax, shipping, the maintenance 
cost over the entire life of the machine and any other associated fees; this 
is the total cost of the machine.  Divide the total machine cost by the 
number of years the machine is expected to be operational; the result is 
the per year cost of the machine.  Divide the per-year cost by the expected 
number of times the machine will be used; this is the cost per procedure.  
Multiply the cost per procedure by 2.0 (includes support overhead); the 
result will be the machine charge. 
 
 
IV      TO DETERMINE THE CHARGE FOR PROCEDURE: 
 
1. To calculate the charge for a procedure add the employee charge, the 
machine charge and supply charges, if not charged for separately. 
  
V        TO DETERMINE THE CHARGE FOR PHARMACY ITEMS:  
 
1. Pharmacy item charges are primarily based on the drug category; the 
following guidelines are to be used.
