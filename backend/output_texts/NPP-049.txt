PURPOSE: 
 
To provide guidance as to the maximum safe amount of blood that can be drawn in a 24-hour period from a 
neonate and pediatric inpatient, in the acute care setting and/or in a clinical research trial. 
 
POLICY: 
 
1. The maximum amount of blood to be drawn per day is three percent (3%) of the total blood volume in a 
24-period.    
2. If the labs are to be drawn require more than three percent (3%), an order from a provider must be 
obtained to draw a maximum of five percent (5%) in a 24-hour period.     
3. If more than five percent (5%) is required in a 24-hour period, the provider must prioritize which labs 
are to be obtained and reschedule remaining for subsequent day(s). 
4. Total blood volume for patients:  
a. Greater than 3 kg = 80 mL x patient weight in kg 
b. Less than 3 kg = 100 mL x patient weight in kg  
5. To calculate 3% = multiply total blood volume x 0.03 
For example: 80 mL x 5 kg (pt weight) = 400 ml (blood volume) 
400 x .03 = 12 mL (3% maximum amount to be drawn in 24-hour period) 
6.  To figure out calculate 5% = multiply total blood volume x 0.05 
For example: 80 mL x 5 kg (pt weight) = 400 ml (blood volume)  
400 x 0.05 = 20 mL (5% maximum amount to be drawn in 24-hour period) 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
1. Nursing and Lab will document Volume of Lab Draw (mL) on Pediatric Intake/Output flowsheet row.  
2. Epic will provide the total amount of blood drawn in the last 24 hours.  This is visible on the patient list 
by adding the column. (See EPIC tip sheet.) 
3. The 24-hour calculated maximum blood draw volume utilizing the 3% calculation will appear on the 
Peds Intake/Output flowsheet row and states 24- hr Calculated Max Blood Draw Volume per Weight.  
This row utilizes the last documented weight for the calculation.  
4. Any blood removed as waste for lab specimens should be accounted for in the Volume of Lab Draw 
(mL) row.  
5. In the event that the provider orders to extend the allowable volume to 5%, this calculation must be done 
manually and should be verified by charge nurse, supervisor, and/or leader.
