ATTENDANCE 
 
Employees of the Nutritional Services Department are expected to report to work on their 
scheduled time. Working hours will be set by the job or position .  A ttendance is a great 
factor in the determination of an employee’s value to OLOLRMC, and should be a 
determining factor in promotions, transfers, salary increases, and continued employment. 
Managers may utilize Kronos records at any time for the purpose of monitoring employee 
attendance. If an employee is unable to work because of illness or any other valid reason, the 
Nutritional Services policy stipulates the following: 
 
CALL-IN PROCEDURE 
• Employees who are absent must call the manager or shift supervisor at least two 
hours prior to their scheduled time of work.  If an employee calls in less than 2 hours 
prior the scheduled shift, this will be considered a no call/no show. 
 
• Employees violating the call-in procedure will be formally counseled and receive an 
unexcused absence.   
 
• All employees must call back and speak to a manager. It is not acceptable to  just 
leave a voice mail. 
 
ILL/ABSENT DAYS 
All employees  absent due to illness for three or more days must submit a physician 
statement and be cleared by  Employee Health before they can return to work .  FMLA 
paperwork should be completed according to hospital policy.  A manager has the right to 
deny PTO u sage for all unexcused absences as well as request an excuse from the 
employee’s physician.  
 
EXCESSIVE ILL/ABSENT DAYS 
The Nutritional Services Department reviews employee attendance and if determined excessive, 
will follow the disciplinary action process.  Excessive absences include: 
• 6 days of absence in any 3 month period or 10 days in a year 
• Repeated instances of absence in conjunction with holidays or days off may be construed 
as a pattern of absence  2 
 
 
 
• Absence from 3 consecutive scheduled shifts (without calling a manager/supervisor) will 
result in disciplinary action up and including termination as this is considered job 
abandonment. 
 
TARDINESS 
Employees are required to report and must be ready for work at the time designated by the 
departmental schedule.  Employees are allowed to clock-in 5 minutes before or clock-out 5 minutes 
after their scheduled shift; otherwise this is considered unapproved overtime and/or tardiness. The 
third incident of tardiness within 60 days will result in progressive counseling/discipline in 
accordance with Medical Center policy. 
 
 
UNSCHEDULED WEEKEND ABSENTEEISM 
Employees who do not report to work on a scheduled weekend will make up this lost time by 
working their next weekend off. There will be no exception for a physician -verified illness, all 
weekends must be made up.  Management will provide the employee with a weekend absenteeism 
form to notify schedule change.    3 
 
 
 
The following form will be used to inform employees of schedule changes.
