Laboratory specimen containers are evaluated to ensure that they do not contribute to analytic interference in the 
assays to be performed. 
This is accomplished through some combination of direct testing by the appropriate section, review of clinical 
literature, and evaluation of information from manufacturers. 
Evaluation of Plastic versus Glass vacutainer tubes supplied by Becton Dickinson and Grenier â€“ Meditech were 
completed on January 21, 1999.
