PURPOSE: To define the process for designating staffing teams that will be implemented during an extended disaster 
response.  
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. OLOLRMC will use Incident Command System (ICS) for assigning staff and leadership responsibilities during a disaster 
event. Individual departments will staff using an Activation Team and Recovery Team concept.  
 
2. The Incident Commander is responsible for activating the Plan when needed to ensure adequate staffing is available to 
meet the organization’s need during the disaster response.  
 
3. Each Department Director or Manager is responsible for assigning all staff to a Disaster Staffing Team, either Activation 
or Recovery. Team rosters will be reviewed at least annually, or more often as necessary to ensure an accurate roster. 
(See Attachment A. Disaster Staffing Team Form) 
 
a. Activation Team Members: Team members assigned to support hospital operations during the initial phases of 
disaster response in an event that lasts more than 12 hours.  The Activation Team will be divided into two 
groups, Activation Day (assigned to the 7:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. shift) and Activation Night (7:00 p.m. – 7:00 a.m. 
shift). Managers should use the current schedule and knowledge of the employee to determine the most 
appropriate assignment.   
 
b. Recovery Team Members: Team members assigned to support hospital operations during Recovery phases of 
disaster response in an event that lasts more than 12 hours. The Recovery Team will be divided into two 
groups, Recovery Day (assigned to the 7:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. shift) and Recovery Night (7:00 p.m. – 7:00 a.m. 
shift). Managers should use the current schedule and knowledge of the employee to determine the most 
appropriate assignment.  
 
4. All employees are responsible for providing a current telephone number and address to their Department Director or 
designee.  
 
5. In order to adequately prepare for unexpected organizational staffing needs, Teams will be expected to be able to work 
rotating twelve (12) hour shifts from initial plan Activation until plan is terminated by the Incident Commander. A 
standard shift from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. will be used throughout the response period. Expected volume and patient 
acuity should be considered when assigning Teams. Team assignments should also be based on skill mix and ability to 
make arrangements for family members.  
 
6. Human Resources is responsible for managing staff assignment from the Personnel Pool based in the Team Member 
Assistance Center. 
a. Departments are defined as either “Core” or “Partner” departments. A list of Core and Partner department 
designations is maintained in Human Resources. Both Core and Partner departments will designate Disaster 
Staffing Teams.  
i. Core Department: Departments essential to the hospital’s core business operation during a disaster 
response.  
ii. Partner Department: Departments that may be closed or curtailed during a disaster response so that 
staff can be re-assigned to support Core functions.  
 
b. Partner Staff will be assigned tasks based on the Core Department Manager’s assessment of need.  
 
c. If a status or needs report is not received from a Core Department, the Personnel Pool (Team Member Assistance Center) will contact the department.  
 
7. Volunteers: Non-hospital volunteers (clinical and non-clinical) will be managed by the Personnel Pool / Team Member 
Assistance Center. Physicians and other Licensed Independent Practitioners (LIPs) will be managed by the Medical Staff 
Office. (See also ECEP016 Volunteer Practitioners and Medical Staff Bylaws.)  
 
PLAN ACTIVATION 
1. Watch Phase: If a disaster  is expected to affect the Baton Rouge area within 72 hours the following staffing actions will 
be implemented: 
a. Activation and Recovery Teams will be placed on stand-by by their Department Head. 
 
b. The Department Head will review the Activation Team roster for shortages (vacation, illness, etc.) and report 
these shortages to their Department Head or Medical Staff Leader as applicable.  
 
c. The Department Head will provide the current roster of the disaster teams to the Planning Chief when 
requested.  
 
2. Warning Phase: If a disaster  is expected to affect the Baton Rouge area within 36 hours, and  the decision to activate 
the hospital’s Emergency Event Plan is made the following actions will be implemented:  
a. Activation Team members will be notified by their Department Head to go home and prepare to return to 
OLOLRMC within twelve (12) hours.  
 
b. Staffing while the Activation Teams are away will be provided by Recovery Team members.  
 
c. Human Resources will print an active employee list to prepare to establish the Personnel Pool.  
 
3. Activation Phase: If a disaster is projected to affect the Baton Rouge area within 24 hours, Activation Team members 
will be either in place at the hospital or within a 30 minute travel distance from the hospital. Recovery Team members 
will be sent home when Activation Teams are in place.  
a. Team members will be alerted as quickly as possible when a hospital emergency plan is activated. Recovery 
Team Members will be placed on stand-by to be activated when the hospital enters the Recovery phase. 
Activation Team members will report to work immediately to their assigned department.

c. Registration: Activation Team members will register with the Personnel Pool (Team Member Assistance 
Center).  
i. Partner Department Team Members will register at the Pool then report to their assigned Core 
department.  
ii. Core department employees will register at their home department. The Manager will relay this 
information by providing a copy of the check-in log to the Pool.

(tmac@ololrmc.com) or by telephone (765-4445) if email is not functioning.

will be paid their normal base rate. 
iii. A team member required to remain on campus longer than 24 hours will be paid their typical rate of 
pay, including any shift differentials when working a designated assignment.  During rest periods, the 
team member will be paid a resting rate equivalent to ½ of their normal base rate.  The team member 
must be allowed at least 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep during this eight hour period to be paid ½ of 
their normal base rate; otherwise the team member will receive their normal base rate during this 
period.  .

termination of the disaster event, Managers will submit a list of Recovery Team Members to Human 
Resources indicating either PTO or ABE (See Attachment C. Disaster Pay List).
