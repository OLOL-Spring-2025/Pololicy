PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this policy is to detail the process by which a new policy or procedure is 
placed into use, who is responsible for its review and signature of the policy, and what 
steps are to be followed in the discontinuance or revision of a policy or procedure. 
 
RESPONSIBILITY: 
The Laboratory Director of the Blood Gas L aboratory, along with the Sr. Director of 
Respiratory Care, are responsible for seeing that this policy is followed. 
 
POLICY: 
Once a final draft of a new or revised policy has been reviewed, approved and signed by 
the Laboratory Directory, the official copy will be placed in the Policy and Procedure 
Manual in its appropriate section. At a minimum, any new or significantly changed policy 
or procedure must be reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Director of the Blood Gas 
Lab and the Director of Respiratory Care prior to being implemented. Individual policies 
will be reviewed and signed every two years by the laboratory director.  An electronic copy 
of any outdated policies will be maintained for no less than two years.  All staff will sign 
to attest at least annually and whenever modifications are made to policies verifying that 
they have reviewed the policies.      
 
When a policy or procedure is discontinued, a paper or electric copy is retained for at least 
two years, recording initial date of use, and retirement date.  
 
If there is a change in Laboratory Director, the new Laboratory Director promptly 
reviews and approves all current policies.
