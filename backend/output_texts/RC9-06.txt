Policy: 
Access to the EMR/Aqure Blood Gas Computer System shall be designed to allow only 
appropriate access of staff personnel, and to restrict the ability of unauthorized individuals 
to modify, remove or access programs or patient data. Overall security measures are the 
responsibility of the Information Security Officer. 
All relevant security issues can be obtained by reviewing this person’s records that are 
kept in the Management Information Department. 
 
As with all patient information, HIPPA mandates that only those personnel with a need to 
know patient information in order to carry out the care of the patient shall access such data. 
All patient information will be maintained in accordance with corporate compliance policy 
COR-203. 
 
Passwords and I.D. codes are removed or deactivated when the associated employee leaves 
or transfers to a position of lesser-authorized access.
