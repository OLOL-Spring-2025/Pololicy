POLICY: The following is a description of the Rehabilitation Center’s Speech Pathology philosophy: 
 
Communication with one’s fellow man and with one’s environment gives quality to life.  Therefore, it is the 
philosophy of the Speech-Language Pathology Division that each patient treated will achieve maximal 
independence in communication within the limits of his/her ability.  Our service is committed to the recognition 
of the dignity of each individual and to maintain the highest standards of quality patient care.  The speech-
language pathologist will inform, educate, and interact with the patient, his/her family or significant others and 
members of the treatment team to ensure optimal use of communicative abilities.  The speech-language 
pathologist will also provide thorough information relative to the patient’s initial status, progress, and discharge 
status to qualified individuals who will treat each patient upon discharge. 
 
It is the purpose of the Speech-Language Pathology Division to provide services of the highest quality, 
individualized to the needs of each patient.  Services include assessment and intervention relating to 
communication, cognition, dysphagia, and hearing.  Included within the scopes of services is education of family 
and staff and cooperative delivery of care with an interdisciplinary team of professionals.
