of Care which is sensitive to the social needs of our patients, their families and loved 
ones, and visitors. 
 
POLICY 
Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center strives to provide a social environment, 
which meets the following goals:

2. An environment of care that supports the positive self-image for the patient and 
preserves his or her human dignity.  
3. Sufficient storage space to meet the personal needs of patients. 
4. Patients are allowed to keep and use personal clothing and possessions unless this 
infringes on othersâ€™ rights or is medically or therapeutically contraindicated (as 
appropriate to the setting or service.) 
5. Adequate privacy to reflect sensitivity and respect for the patient is provided. 
6. Activities to support the development and maintenance of the patient's interests, 
skills, and opportunities for personal growth are provided.

environment via routine department inspections (Environment of Care/Life Safety
