Policy Manual: Organizational Section: Clinical 
Title: Patient Assessment/Reassessment Policy Reference #: OrgClin/031 
Supersedes #: AD/B/034 
Date of Origination: July, 1997 Last Review Date: September 1, 2024 
Last Revision Date: October 10, 2016 
  
PURPOSE 
To provide guidelines for an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach in assessing, reassessing, 
planning, and providing care to meet each patient’s individualized needs for treatment. 
POLICY    
1. The assessment or gathering of data begins with the patient’s first contact in all settings. A 
registered nurse assesses the patient’s need for nursing care in all settings where nursing care is 
provided  
2. The Registered Nurse (RN) completes the initial Assessment and reviews/completes the initial 
Profile, including screening assessments, within 24 hours on all inpatients.  The type of assessment 
performed depends on the assessing discipline and the patient’s diagnosis, setting, type of care 
sought, response to previous care, consent to treatment, and current condition.  
 
3. Qualified members of the patient’s treatment team identify treatment priorities that will be 
addressed in the Interdisciplinary Plan of Care. Less urgent needs may not be included in the active 
plan.  Unresolved identified needs may be referred to the appropriate resource as deemed necessary. 
a. Age appropriate documentation will be completed for developmental milestones according to 
the age categories defined by Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL):  
i. Infant: 0-12 months 
ii. Toddler: 13 months-3 years 
iii. Child: 4-12years 
iv. Adolescent: 13-18 years 
v. Young Adult: 19-40 years 
vi. Middle Adult: 41-74 years 
vii. Geriatric: 75 years or greater 
4. Discharge planning begins with the first contact with the patient and/or family and continues 
throughout the patient’s experience. 
5. All patients referred for rehabilitation services receive a functional assessment. 
6. Ongoing reassessment is done throughout the course of the patient’s stay with changes to the plan of 
care as appropriate.  Reassessment will be performed in the following situations or as deemed 
appropriate by the Registered Nurse: 
a. Related to patient’s course of treatment 
b. Based on patient's response to treatment 
c. When a new significant change occurs in patient’s condition.  For example, breathing effort, 
circulatory status, and level of consciousness. OC-031

7. The timeframes for completion of the initial assessments and scheduled reassessments are 
department specific; see attached Table of Assessment/Reassessment Time Frames. 
8. The timeframes for unscheduled/ PRN assessments and reassessments depend on the intervention 
and the patient response. 
9. Outpatients may be reassessed during or at the end of the initial visit and/or on subsequent visits. 
10. All assessments and reassessments are documented in the patient’s medical record. 
11. Entries into the patient chart should be made at the time the event occurred.                 
EXCEPTION: Entries into the patient chart beyond the time the event occurred must be identified 
as such, with appropriate date and time of occurrence, and time of late entry. 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1. Nursing Documentation Triggers to Other Disciplines: The Admission Profile, Admission 
Assessment, and Plan of Care contain screening tools for Food and Nutrition Services, Physical 
Medicine (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy), and Medical Management (social 
services).  Documented responses to specific questions generates a report to these other disciplines; 
an asterisk (*) on the computer screen indicates the essential information needed to trigger a referral. 
Due to the dynamics of an evolving Clinical Information System, the creation of new triggers in 
response to meeting patient needs is an ongoing process. 
Examples: 
a. The Admission Assessment contains questions regarding functional status or development 
milestones, discharge needs, educational needs, level of consciousness, and tube feedings.  
Responses to these data points may generate a report to Physical Medicine, Medical 
Management, and/or Food and Nutritional Services. 
b. The Admission Profile contains questions regarding medical history, eating and feeding 
problems, and food restrictions that may generate a report to Food and Nutritional Services 
and Physical Medicine. 
c. The Fall Risk Assessment and the Braden Scale responses may generate a report to Physical 
Medicine or Wound, Ostomy and Continence.
