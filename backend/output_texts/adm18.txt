PURPOSE: 
To define guidelines for adequate nursing staff in the Department of Emergency Services. 
POLICY: 
1. Staffing levels in Emergency Services are based on patient census, acuity, and the number of 
visits per hour. 
2. This data is obtained from census figures, admissions/discharges/transfer information, and 
discharge acuity evaluations , which is analyzed for trending of patient visits, peak census, and 
increased acuity.  From this information, minimum and ideal staffing levels are obtained. 
3. Ancillary support is provided by Emergency Department Techs and ED Nurse Techs , who 
function under the guidelines of their job description  and serve as supplements to professional 
staffing levels. 
4. If staffing levels cannot be met, limiting availability of patient care areas until supplemental staff 
resources can be obtained is utilized.  The degree to which the operation is limited is dependent 
on the number of staff, their level of practice, experience, and patient acuity. 
5. Due to uncertainty of patient acuities and census, operational decision s are made by the ED 
Management Team or Charge Nurse on an ongoing basis to assure adequate staffing levels to 
meet the current demands of the department.   
6. The Management Team/Charge Nurse is responsible for replacing staff due to call-ins.
