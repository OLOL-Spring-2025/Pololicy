Clinical Ethics Consultation Guide 
The primary role of the Ethics Consultation Service is to support and foster decision -making that 
is consistent with the patient’s values and goals, and with the Mission, Vision, Values and 
Catholic Identity of FMOLHS.   While the Ethics Consultation Service is not a decision -making 
body per se, it is a consultation team that makes recommendations that provides substantive 
guidance to patients and families, as well as clinical and organization al decision-makers. Such 
recommendations should include a clearly articulated rationale as to why one course of action is 
permissible or preferable within the Catholic moral perspective and the clinical circumstances of 
particular cases. The following steps are intended to guide the process of arriving at a 
recommendation as the outcome of a consultation request.  
 
Step One: Identify the question(s)  
• Why was the consult or assessment called?  
• Is this the right question or set of questions?  
 
Step Two:  Gather relevant data 
• What is the patient’s current medical status, diagnosis, and prognosis?  
• What are the benefits and burdens of the recommended treatment?  
• What are the benefits and burdens of reasonable alternative treatments?  
• What is the life expectancy—treated or untreated?  
• What are the views of the caregivers and consultants?  
Step Three: Clarify relevant concepts  
• What is the assessment of the patient’s decision-making capacity?  
• Has there been true informed consent? Has the patient’s choice been voluntary?  
• Have the patient’s best interests or preferences been determined? That is, a good 
faith determination of what treatment would promote the patient’s overall greatest 
welfare, considering all relevant factors, and made in accordance with ethical and 
medical standards.  
 
Step Four:  Clarify related normative issues 
• What are the patient’s personal and social factors?  
• What is the patient’s value system?  
• What is the patient’s personal assessment of quality of life?  
• What are the patient’s current expressed choices?  
• Are there any advanced directives?  
• What is the patient’s/family’s religion? Is expense a factor?  
• Are there applicable state statutes? Is there applicable case law?  
• Is there any potential liability?  
• Are there applicable hospital policies? 
 
Step Five:  Identify a range of morally acceptable options  
• Has the patient been assured as much autonomous choice as possible?  
• Are the recommendations consistent with appropriate medical goals for this 
patient in these circumstances?  2 
 
• Are the recommendations consistent with the patient’s preferences or best 
interests?  
• If there is a conflict between the patient’s preference/best interests and the 
medical indications, how can it be resolved?  
• Are the recommendations consistent with ethical principles?  
• Are the recommendations consistent with the Ethical and Religious Directives 
for Catholic Health Care Services? 
 
Step Six:  Review & Follow-up  
• Were all parties involved comfortable with the decision? If not, were the 
provisions for conscience found to be acceptable?  
• Were individuals with relevant expertise consulted?  
• Was informed consent obtained prior to implementation?  
• Were appropriate steps taken to act in a timely manner?  
• Does this issue require an institutional response?  
• What learning resulted from this case or issue?  Will this case be presented as a 
learning opportunity at an Ethics Committee meeting? 
• Was the consult properly documented?  Was the outcome reported to the 
appropriate stakeholders? 
• Did we follow back up with the Nursing Unit or department calling the consult to 
inform of the outcome? 
• Is there education or training needed from this ethics consultation?
