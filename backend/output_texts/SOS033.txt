PURPOSE: 
To reduce the incidence of intraoperative blood-borne pathogen exposures that occur during hand-
to-hand transfer of sharp items. 
 
POLICY: 
The practice of hands-free transfer or no touch technique is recommended for health professionals 
who participate in the intraoperative transfer and handling of sharp items. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. A dedicated “neutral” zone for the placement and retrieval of sharp items is established at 
the beginning of the surgical procedure.  Several methods may be employed. 
a. A single neutral zone for placement and retrieval of sharps. 
 b. Two separate dedicated zones… one for placement and one for retrieval. 
 
2. Use of an instrument mat, magnetic pad, safety transfer basin, or designated area of the 
Mayo stand as the neutral zone. 
 
3. Only place, pass, and handle one sharp at a time. When placing a sharp item in the neutral 
zone the scrub person should precede the action with a verbal notification such as: “Scalpel” 
or “Gelpi” 
 
4. Sharp items to be passed in this manner include but are not limited to the following: 
 a. Scalpels 
 b. Needles 
 c. Sharp Retractors 
 d. Trocars 
 e. Syringe and Needle 
 
5. If using a neutral zone compromises safety, use a modified neutral zone by safely passing 
sharp directly to surgeon and having it returned to a designated neutral zone.  
 
6. Instruments that do not present a puncture threat may be transferred directly in a hand-to-
hand fashion.
