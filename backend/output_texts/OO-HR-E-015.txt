PURPOSE 
The purpose of this policy is to describe the content of job descriptions as well as the development 
process. Job descriptions are used for selecting, orienting, training, compensating, evaluating and 
informing employees and potential employees of the requirements of the job.   
 
POLICY 
A. Each position (or related set of positions) is defined in a written job description.  The job description 
defines the general purpose and scope of the position(s) as well as the major duties and 
responsibilities of the job.  
B. In the case of positions responsible for the assessment, treatment, or care of patients, the job 
description will address the provision of such care in a manner appropriate to the age of the patient. 
C. The job description also identifies formal reporting relationships.  
D. Job descriptions also include minimum requirements (i.e., knowledge, skills and abilities) in terms of 
physical demands, education, training, licensure or registry, and/or experience, and essential job 
duties.  These job requirements guide decisions related to selection, placement, and compensation.   
 
PROCEDURES 
1. It is the responsibility of each department head to ensure that a job description for each job is 
maintained and periodically updated. Managers may seek assistance from Human Resources when 
needed. 
2. Job descriptions are to be reviewed by leaders on an on-going basis, particularly at the time of 
formal performance evaluation.  
3. Revisions to job descriptions should be completed in partnership with Human Resources for 
implementation.
