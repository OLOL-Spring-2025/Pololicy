PURPOSE: 
To provide an accepted standard for the collection of specimens by Venipuncture personnel 
 
Addresses: 
Venipuncture Charge Techs 
Venipuncture Phlebotomists 
 
POLICY: 
The laboratory accepts specimens that are of sufficient quality for testing 
 
PROCEDURE:  
A. Specimen labeling  
• Inpatient specimen labeling is to have the following documentation affixed to the primary specimen 
container:  
o Patient first and last name 
o Medical record number (inpatient) 
o Phlebotomist identifier when not captured by Rover Device (Network ID) 
o Time of collection (military time & date) 
o Required data is recorded in a legible manor that is easily readable by another individual 
o Primary specimen containers lacking patient name and medical record number are not 
acceptable for testing and require recollection. 
• Outpatient specimen labeling is to have the following documentation affixed to the primary 
specimen container 
o  Patient first and last name  
o Date of birth  
o Phlebotomist identifier (Network ID) 
o Time of collection (military time & date) 
o Required data is recorded in a legible manor that is easily readable by another individual 
o Primary specimen containers lacking patient name and date of birth are not acceptable for 
testing, the patient is recalled and recollected 
• Trauma Alert patient specimen labeling 
o Specimens from trauma patients are labeled according to the Trauma Alert policy (refer to 
Trauma Alert and Emergency Codes -Venipuncture Reports to Procedure) OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

• Code  patient labeling 
o Specimens from code patients are labeled according to Emergency Codes Policy (refer to 
Trauma Alert and Emergency Codes -Venipuncture Reports to Procedure) 
B. Fill blood collection tubes using the manufacture’s fill volumes  
• Properly fill blood specimen collection tubes  
• The amount of anticoagulant in a tube is directly related to the volume of  blood the tube will hold; 
filling blood collection tubes with less than the required amount of blood volume may affect sample 
testing   
• Each tube has an ideal fill volume in milliliters (ml) noted on the label of the tube 
• Our tube manufacture places a visual marker (black square ■) on the tube’s label that indicates when a 
tube has been adequate filled 
o After filling, hold the tube vertically or top up and compare the level of the blood in the tube to 
the black mark on the label 
o The tube is properly filled when the level of the blood in the tube closely matches the black 
mark on the tube label 
• Watching  the blood enter the tube will also tell you that a tube has been properly filled 
o Carefully watch the turbulence created as the vacuum pulls the blood into the tube 
o Blood entering the tube creates movement 
o The tube is completely filled when the movement of blood ceases or, in other words, the 
vacuum the tube contained has been exhausted 
o After filling, hold the tube upright (top up) and compare the level of blood in the tube to the 
manufactures fill mark on the tube label 
o The tube is properly filled when the level of the blood closely matches the black mark 
o Improperly or under filled tubes may not be accepted for laboratory testing 
o Acceptability for testing of an improperly filled tube should be verified with the laboratory 
section performing the test  
o Recollection of the sample will be determined by personnel from the laboratory testing section  
o Request outpatients to remain in the laboratory until specimen acceptability has been 
determined to avoid having to recall the patient for a recollection 
C.  Wrong tube drawn for the required test 
• Most of the testing done in our laboratory requires specimens that have been collected using a 
specified coagulant or anticoagulant 
• Each laboratory test label has the required tube type listed   
• Generally, one type of tube/container cannot be substituted  for another type 
• The acceptability of a specimen placed in the wrong collection container is determined by personnel 
from the laboratory section performing the requested test 
• A test collected in the wrong tube/container that is not acceptable for testing is to be recollected 
D. Hemolysis 
• Hemolysis occurs when the cell membrane of a red blood cell (RBC) breaks and releases the protein 
hemoglobin that is contained within each red blood cell 
• Hemoglobin interferes with most testing done in the laboratory  OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

• Specimens contaminated with hemoglobin are not usually used for laboratory testing and will need to 
be recollected 
E. Clotted samples drawn in anticoagulated tubes 
• The anticoagulant in a tube is designed to prevent the blood from forming a clot 
• In some cases: 
o The process of clotting requires the use of  a number of proteins  
o As these proteins are used in the clotting process, they are removed from the sample 
o If the test is being done to determine the level of these proteins, the measured level will be very 
low producing a misleading test result 
• In other cases: 
o The process of clotting removes or entangles some of the formed elements present in our blood 
o The clotting process will cause platelets to become activated and stick together  
o The clotting process will also trap platelets and red blood cells in the clot structure reducing the 
number of both elements present in the sample 
• Clotted specimens drawn in anticoagulated containers require recollection 
 
F.  Specimens collected using improper handling procedures 
• Certain tests require that the specimen submitted be collected using a specified process that protects 
or stabilizes the substances being analyzed 
o The specified collection process is designed to protect the substance that is being measured 
o Failure to use the specified collection technique will result in a specimen that will not give a 
true result.  A specimen that has been improperly collected will produce a result that is not a 
true measure of the substance of interest 
o Specimens collected improperly will require recollection 
G. Specimen Containers 
o Specimen containers with specimens being submitted for testing should appear to be intact and 
undamaged 
o Specimens are to be submitted in clean, non-contaminated containers 
o Specimens with requests for culture and other tests requiring sterile collection are to be 
submitted in sterile containers 
o Specimen containers with conflicting information, improperly sealed, or otherwise damaged 
may be rejected for testing 
H. Specimens collected for the Blood Bank  
• Blood Bank specimens for cross match require the Blood Bank Identification System, patient 
armbanding, and are labeled as follows: 
o Blood bank packet forms are to be labeled with the patient name, date of birth and have the date 
and time of specimen collection 
o Specimen tube containers are labeled with the patient name,  date of birth, date and time of 
collection, Network ID of the drawing phlebotomist and a blood bank armband number  
o Improperly labeled specimens are not accepted for testing and are recollected  
o Consult with the blood bank as needed

I. Indwelling Lines, Heparin or Saline Locks, Vascular Access Devices (VADs) 
• Phlebotomists are not permitted to draw blood from indwelling lines, shunts, or IVs 
• Obtaining blood from these lines can be a potential source of test error due to hemolysis and 
incomplete flushing of collection site, resulting in contamination and/or dilution of the specimen, 
contributing to inaccurate results  
• Whenever possible, blood should be drawn from the opposite arm from the line 
• Specimens that are contaminated or hemolyzed will be submitted for recollection. 
Limitations of Procedure: 
• Identification labels are to be attached to the primary specimen container 
• Specimens with labeling not attached directly to the primary specimen container will not be 
accepted for testing and are to be redrawn  
• Specimen labeling missing the drawing tech identifier or time of draw may be accepted for 
laboratory testing if the missing information can be found documented on the phlebotomist’s 
workload recording form 
• Specimen tubes drawn for coagulation testing should be filled to at least 90% of the correct blood 
volume
