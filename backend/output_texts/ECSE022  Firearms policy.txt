OUR LADY OF THE LAKE SECURITY DEPARTMENT FIREARMS AFFIDAVIT 
 
 
1. The firearm that I carry in the performance of my duties has been issued to me for the 
protection of LIFE. It is intended to be used only as a LAST RESORT to protect my life or the life 
of another person when there are no other means available to do so. 
 
2. While on duty, I will keep my firearm holstered with the safety strap in the secured position. I 
will not draw my firearm unless I intent to use it to protect LIFE. I will not remove it from its 
holster to show or display it to any person, except for regular inspections by my supervisor or 
clearing the weapon of any chambered rounds prior to end of watch. 
 
3. I know that all firearms are dangerous, and they will KILL. I also know that when handled with 
common sense, respect, and proper safety precautions there can be no excuse for an 
unintentional discharge of my firearm. 
 
4. I will not leave my firearm where anyone else can handle it. When not on my person, my 
firearm will be locked in the Security locker assigned to me within the hospital Security dispatch 
office. 
 
5. I will never draw my firearm as a bluff. I will never place my finger inside the trigger guard 
unless my firearm is pointed at a target, and I intend to fire. I will never point my firearm at 
anyone or anything I do not intend to shoot. I will never fire a warning shot. Regardless of the 
circumstances, I will never shoot my firearm when doing so would jeopardize the safety of 
innocent people. 
 
6. I will never engage in “quick draw” contests or other unprofessional horseplay with my 
firearm, or with any other firearm on hospital property or on the pistol range. I will practice 
shooting my firearm only on a pistol range approved by the Director of Security. 
 
7. I will always keep my firearm clean. I understand that a dirty or rusty firearm is grounds for 
disciplinary action. I will not attempt to disassemble my firearm beyond field striping in 
accordance with departmental procedures, or to modify my firearm or holster in any way. I will 
not allow anyone other than a gunsmith approved by the Director of Security to perform any 
work on my firearm other than routine cleaning, which is my responsibility. I will never use 
WD40 or any other aerosol lubricant on my firearm. 
 
8. I will load my firearm with and carry only 9mm caliber service ammunition issued to me by 
the Director of Security. I will be especially careful to only unload or clear my weapon in the 
identified and or designated clearing area.

9. I will not carry any other firearm other than the one issued to me while on duty unless 
authorized to do so in writing by the Director of Security and I have qualified with it as required 
by departmental standards (POST).  
 
10. I understand that I am required to store my firearm in the Security locker provided and 
assigned to me at Our Lady of The Lake Regional Medical Center. I know that my Security locker 
may be opened, and my firearm inspected at any time by the Director of Security or my 
supervisor, and that I may be subject to disciplinary action if my firearm has not been properly 
maintained. 
 
11. I understand that violation of any of the above standards will result in disciplinary action 
that may include termination.
