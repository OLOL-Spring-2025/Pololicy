Section:  Clinical 
Title:  Guidelines for Stem Cell Processing and Dosing For Transplant 
Date of Origination: 12/4/2024 Policy Reference #: CT-CLIN-115  
Revision Date:  Effective Date: 12/23/2024 
 
SCOPE:  
This policy/procedure applies to the Blood Cancer and Cellular Therapy Program (BCCT) 
located at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical (OLOL).  
PURPOSE:   
 To establish guidelines for the number of stem cells (peripheral blood and/or marrow) infused 
after high dose chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiotherapy for transplant. 
DEFINITIONS: 
N/A 
POLICY/PROCEDURE: 
A. Following the collection of hematopoietic progenitor cells by apheresis, the cellular therapy 
lab (processing) personnel shall perform CD34+ cell count and cell viability to determine 
product quality prior to freezing the product. 
B. Two (2) 0.5-1 ml samples taken from the product will be frozen with the product as needed 
for quality control purposes prior to the patient’s transplant. 
1. The additional sample frozen for quality control purposes will be thawed within one (1) 
month prior to the patient beginning any portion of the preparative regimen. 
a. This sample will be tested for nucleated cell count and cell viability. The CD34+ 
test will be performed if cell viability is < 70%. 
C.  If it is determined the CD34+ cell count is < 2X106 /kg, the processing lab personnel shall 
notify the TCT Center Medical Director and/or the attending transplant physician 
immediately, prior to the patient admission, for appropriate treatment decisions. 
D. Whenever bone marrow is used as a rescue, the entire product should be infused. 
E. For hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from apheresis (HPC, A), for single 
autologous transplant of CD34+ cells ≥ 2 x 106 /kg, cells should be infused. 
1. When tandem transplants are planned and in cases where cryopreservation might be 
advantageous for potential post-treatment cytopenia. EXAMPLE: planned radiation, 
with the directions from the medical TCT program director cell dose can be divided to 
be infused in multiple transplants with ≥ 2 x 106 /kg CD34+ cells at each time. 
F. For hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from apheresis (HPCs, A) for allogeneic 
transplant the total number of cells to be infused should be ≥2 x 106 to ≤ 5 x 106 CD34/kg 
and cryopreserve the remainder. These amounts exclude the samples needed by the Cellular 
Therapy Processing Facility (CTPF). 
G. For hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from marrow collection. 
1. The target for unprocessed bone marrow is: ≥2 x 108 TNC/kg.

2. The target for processed bone marrow is: 0.3 x 108 MNC/kg. 
3. The entire marrow product (unprocessed or processed) excluding samples needed by 
the CTPF will be infused. 
H. The number of CD34+ cells in the remaining product should be quantified prior to 
cryopreservation so that the cells can be aliquoted appropriately. 
I. For all transplants the infused cell dose is documented in the medical record. 
J. Any product deviation requiring reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shall 
be reported within the required time frame by the BCCT Quality Manager as directed by the 
BCCT Medical Director.
