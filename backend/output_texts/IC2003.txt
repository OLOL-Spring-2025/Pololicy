PURPOSE: 
To state the Infection Prevention and Control Department's authority in environmental culturing. 
 
POLICY: 
To limit unnecessary culturing of the enviroment or of personnel, such culturing shall be directed and 
guided by the Infection Prevention and Control Department and follow a written plan. 
 
The risk of healthcare-associated infections related to environmental contamination is more effectively 
controlled by adherence to tested protocols for processing than by routine sampling.  Microbiologic 
sampling should therefore be directed toward evaluation of contamination known to be associated with a 
risk of healthcare-associated infection or should be used to investigate specific objects or areas that have 
been incriminated epidemiologically in its transmission. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. Routine Environmental Culture 
Routine environmental culture programs are those that are conducted on a regularly scheduled basis, 
irrespective of the characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in the institution. 
Routine microbiological surveillance of the inanimate environment or of personnel, except for 
research purposes, shall be limited to the following: 
A. Steam sterilizers are monitored with a commercial preparation of spores of Geobacillus 
stearothermophilus. Sterilizer loads with implantable objects shall be challenged with a 
biological indicator.(Refer to Sterile Processing policies SPS018 and SPS041) 
 
B. Legionella testing is directed through the Water Management Workgroup. (Refer to Environment 
of Care policy ECUS000) 
 
The procedure for collection, processing of culture data, and reporting are found in the Culture 
Interpretation Procedure Manual in Microbiology. 
 
All other environmental cultures shall be at the direction and order of the Infection Prevention and 
Control Department and in consultation with Microbiology.  Data is reviewed to ensure that the resulting 
culturing plan is appropriate and consistent with best practices.
