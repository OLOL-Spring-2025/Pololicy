I. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to outline the process for development, 
approval, and implementation of a physician-approved, patient-driven Respiratory 
Protocol.  
 
II. POLICY:  Physician–approved protocols must follow a specific process prior to 
approval and implementation for patient care.  Once approved, the protocols are 
reviewed annually by the Medical Executive Committee. Approved protocols can 
be followed by all licensed Respiratory therapists employed by Our Lady of the 
Lake main campus (OLOL), Our Lady of the Lake Ascension (OLOLASC), Our 
Lady of the Lake Livingston (OLOLLIV), Our Lady of the Lake North Baton 
Rouge ED (OLOL NBR) and Our Lady of the Lake Children’s Hospital 
(OLOLCH). 
 
III. Process for Protocol Implementation 
a. Protocol Development: 
i. Patient-driven Respiratory Protocols are developed by the Respiratory 
Leadership team in collaboration with the medical staff. 
ii. Protocol development is based on best practices utilizing medical 
literature as supportive information. 
iii. Protocols are attributed to improving efficiency of care, reducing 
misallocated therapy, and ensuring that treatments have established 
indicators. 
b. Protocol Approval Process: 
i. Once the protocol is written, the Respiratory Care Medical Director 
must grant approval for each site it will be utilized.  
ii. Once the Respiratory Care Medical director approves, the protocol will 
be brought to the Health System for Respiratory leadership approval.    
iii. The respiratory leader of each hospital will review and gain approval 
from their medical director when applicable.   
1. If the protocol will be implemented throughout the health 
system, the medical director of each facility will bring the 
protocol to the perspective MEC committee at each hospital for 
approval.  If all facilities do not approve the protocol, the 
Respiratory Director and Medical Director may request 
assistance from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO).  
2. If the protocol will not be implemented at all facilities, the 
facilities that will utilize the protocol shall follow the approval 
process as stated above.   
iv. Once approval has been received from all facilities, the protocol is then 
taken to the Medical Executive Committee for final approval.   
v. All protocols will be reviewed annually at Our Lady of the Lake 
facilities by the MEC. 
c. Protocol Implementation 
i. Before use of the protocol, Respiratory therapists shall be provided 
with education to ensure competence of the new protocol.   
ii. Validation of competence may be one of the following: a completed 
written competency, a read and sign, day of learning, team member 
workshop, departmental in-services, or huddles, etc.  
iii. The approved protocol must be available as a reference in the patient 
electronic medical record (EMR).   
d. Ordering of the Protocol & Protocol Compliance 
i. When a protocol is ordered, the Respiratory therapist is responsible for 
following the protocol as ordered.   
ii. Respiratory leadership will conduct audits of the protocol as needed to 
validate compliance.
