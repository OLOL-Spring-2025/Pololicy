I attest that:
    I understand that during direct contact with a patient’s blood or body 
fluids that I could be exposed to potentially infectious blood borne 
pathogens, including but not limited to, AIDS, Hepatitis B and C. 
 
    If I am considered to be at risk for occupational exposure, I acknowledge 
that I have been provided education from my employer about blood 
borne pathogens and the appropriate measures to protect myself, 
including but not limited to, safe needle handling practices, use of 
personal protective equipment, hand washing, and the administration of 
prophylactic vaccines as stipulated by OSHA/NIOSH and CDC.
