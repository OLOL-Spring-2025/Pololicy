LOCATION SPECIFICS 
Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center 
5000 Hennessey Blvd, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 
• 10,000-gallon underground diesel storage tank that is registered with DEQ and registration is 
renewed annually.  The tank is shared by two emergency generators.  Each of these generators 
has its own 500-gallon day tank.  Combined, our storage capacity can supply 96 hours of 
continuous run time at 87% load (109 gallons per hour). 
• St. Mary’s Tower has a 4,400-gallon tank capable of supplying 96 hours of continuous run time 
at 46% load (45 gallons per hour). 
• Fuel may be ordered at any time by contacting Lard Oil Company for restocking of fuel. 
 
Our Lady of the Lake Children’s Hospital (OLOLCH) 
8200 Constantin Blvd, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 
• OLOLCH has a 40,000 gallon above ground diesel storage tank that is shared by two emergency 
generators.  In addition, each of these generators has its own 100-gallon day tank.  
 
• These generators will have to run together to support the full load of the hospital at 1850 kw 
demand load.  The two generators running together at 60% load will use 70 gallons per hour. 
This equals 287 hours of continuous runtime at demand load or 12 days.
