6.6.1. If a Repair is needed, and the technician determines it can be 
handled in-house, following will be completed:
6.6.2. Sufficient troubleshooting is required to verify the reported failure 
and determine its origin. This approach can isolate the failure to 
single replaceable component/part or it could point to device or 
system level issue.
6.6.3. For component /part level type of problem, the technician will 
determine whether parts need to be ordered and order those either 
from manufacturer or source the parts from an approved supplier 
through the WOT.

safety inspection and even re-calibration where needed.
6.6.8. Technician will document these steps at the completion of each

6.7.1. In order to effectively create technical and historical service records 
for all devices, the technician is responsible for documenting in detail 
all troubleshooting, repair, and/or testing for each device that has 
been serviced.  The documentation should be in the Service Notes 
section of the Work Order Task and should include details such as 
what troubleshooting was done, any tests performed and the 
outcome, what repairs and/or parts that were needed, and what the 
technician did to make the device patient ready.  The technician 
should also include any other pertinent details that are needed to 
accurately describe what was done to each device.
NOTE: Exception Reporting on Repairs is not acceptable
6.7.2. For devices that do not meet the accepted tolerance, technicians 
are to document the before and after measurements to have a 
documented record of before and after results. 
6.7.3. Service notes will be professional, to the point, and aligned with 
labor lines and time entries. They will have logical progression 
through the events of the repair with a clear conclusion in the end.
6.7.4. Complete all close questions accurately.
6.7.5. Work notes will be updated as needed with "behind the scenes" 
information such as customer communication, vendor or service 
communications. Work notes should remain factual and should not 
include any subjective comments or include personal reflections.
6.7.6. If a PM is to be completed after the repair has been completed, the 
technician must open a PM WOT and document the PM within that 
WOT. PM work should never be documented within the repair WOT.
6.8.Short Description Fields
6.8.1. Short description field of the WOT will be populated based off the 
reported problem by the Customer
6.8.2. The technician should update the short description upon 
troubleshooting based on the main cause of the failure
