POLICY: 
The Birthday rule is and informal procedure used in the health insurance industry to help 
determine which health insurance is considered “ primary “ when children are listed as 
dependents on multiple health plans.  The insurance plans need to coordinate benefits so 
that the claim is paid properly.   
 
PROCEDURE: 
The Birthday rule determines which plan should be primary.  It states that the health plan 
of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year will be considered the 
primary plan.  
 
Exceptions to the rule include parents that share the same Birthday, divorced or separated 
parents, active employees and different plan types.   
 
When parents have the same Birthday, the parent which has had their plan longer, pays 
first.   
When the parents are either divorced or separated, the plan of the parent who has legal 
custody will be considered primary.  If the parent with custody is remarried, the new 
spouse’s plan would then be considered secondary.  The plan of the parent without custody 
would pay any additional expenses not covered.   
If one spouse is currently employed and has insurance and the other spouse has coverage 
through a former employer ( COBRA), the plan of the currently employed spouse would be 
primary. 
Group Plans are considered primary over individual plans.
