OUR LADY OF THE LAKE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER 
Policy Manual: Organizational Section: General 
Title: Records Management Policy Reference #: OrgOps/GN/031 
Supersedes #:  
Date of Origination: April 18th, 2006 Last Review Date: October 6, 2009 
Last Revision Date:  March 6, 2018 
 
PURPOSE   
To establish the policy and procedures for the creation, use, maintenance, retention, preservation, and disposal 
of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) records. 
 
POLICY               
Maintenance.  It is the Hospital’s policy to apply effective and cost efficient management techniques to 
maintain complete and accurate records.  Records will be retained in accordance with all applicable laws and 
regulations, with this policy and with department specific requirements. Department specific requirements shall 
not conflict with this policy. The specific record retention requirements are listed on Exhibit A.   Proposed 
changes, additions, or revisions to the record retention requirements will be submitted to the Legal Department 
for review and approval.  The Hospital departments that are responsible for specific records are set forth on 
Exhibit A.  Each department listed on Exhibit A will designate a person who is responsible for implementing 
and maintaining the records management program (the Department Records Coordinator). 
 
Destruction.  Records that have satisfied their required period of retention as set forth on Exhibit A may be 
destroyed when the specific retention period has expired and a Certificate of Destruction form as set forth on 
Exhibit B is executed. Records that cannot be destroyed include records of matters known to be in litigation or 
known to be under investigation or records with a permanent retention.  In the event of a lawsuit or government 
investigation, that is known to OLOL, the applicable records cannot be destroyed until the lawsuit or 
investigation has been finalized.  Once the litigation/investigation has been finalized and after obtaining the 
written approval of the Chief Legal Counsel, the records may be destroyed in accordance with the Records 
Retention Schedules.  OLOL records must be destroyed in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of the 
records and renders the information no longer recognizable as OLOL records. The approved methods to destroy 
OLOL records include, but are not limited to, recycling, shredding, burning, pulping, pulverizing, and magnetic 
degaussing. OLOL records cannot be placed in trash receptacles unless the records are rendered no longer 
recognizable as an OLOL record.  A Certificate of Destruction form  must be approved and signed by the 
appropriate management staff prior to the destruction of records.   Records are to be reviewed annually by the 
Records Coordinator to determine the status of the record. 
 
Integrity of Records.  No one may falsify document information in any record or document.  No one may falsify 
or inappropriately alter information in any record or document. 
    
Confidential Information.  Records containing confidential and proprietary information will be securely 
maintained, controlled and protected to prevent unauthorized access. 
 
Disaster.  Vital and official records will be retained and protected to ensure OLOL’s continued operations in the 
event of a natural or man-made disaster. 
 
Ownership.  All records generated and received by OLOL are the property of OLOL.  No OLOL employee, by 
virtue of his or her position, has any personal or property right to such records even though he or she may have 
developed or compiled them. 
 OO-GN-031 
Page 2 of 58 
Compliance.  Information pertaining to unauthorized destruction, removal or use of OLOL records or regarding 
falsifying or inappropriately altering information in a record or document should be reported to management, 
either directly or through the Corporate Compliance Hotline at 1-225-765-6507. 
 
 
DEFINITIONS 
Records:  A record is recorded information, regardless of medium or characteristic, which can be retrieved at 
any time.  It includes all original documents, papers, letters, x-rays, cards, books, maps, photographs, blueprints, 
sound or video recordings, microfilm, magnetic tape, electronic media, and other information recording media, 
regardless of physical form or characteristic, that are generated and/or received in connection with transacting 
OLOL’s business and are related to OLOL’s mission and operational, legal, fiscal and historical purposes. 
 
Business records.  OLOL  business records include, but are not limited to, letterhead correspondence, legal 
opinions, real estate documents, directives and policies, official meeting minutes, personnel records, benefit 
programs, purchasing requisitions and invoices, accounts payable and receivable documents, tax documents, 
reimbursement documents, completed and signed forms, contracts, insurance documents, general ledgers, audit 
reports,  financial reports and records necessary to protect the integrity of the hospital’s compliance process and 
confirm the effectiveness of the program include, but are not limited to, the following: documentation that 
employees were adequately trained; reports from the compliance hotline, including the nature and results of any 
investigation that was conducted; modifications to the compliance program; self-disclosures; and the results of 
the hospital’s auditing and monitoring efforts. 
 
Medical records.  Refer to FMOLHS Medical Record Retention and Destruction policy 
 
Non-Records:  Non-records material includes duplicate copies of correspondence, duplicate copies of records 
used for short-term reference purposes, blank forms, stocks of publications, magazines, publications from 
professional organizations, newspapers, public telephone directories, and transitory messages used primarily for 
the informal communication of information.  Transitory messages do not set policy, establish guidelines or 
procedures, certify a transaction, or become a receipt.  Transitory messages may include, but are not limited to, 
e-mail messages with short-lived or no administrative value, voice mail, self-sticking notes and telephone 
messages.   
 
Discretion should be used in determining whether to generate or retain transitory messages in the nature of 
notes of unofficial meetings, telephone conversations, or other personal notes.  If generated, such records should 
be routinely discarded when they are no longer useful.  For example, when the informal record, such as an 
employee’s personal notes, is transferred to a more formal record, such as an incident report, the notes are no 
longer useful and should be discarded. Preliminary working papers and superseded drafts, particularly after 
subsequent versions are finalized, should be discarded.  E-mail that contains no substantive data, such as 
invitations to lunch and responses to such, should be routinely discarded. 
 
The retention schedules do not apply to non-records.  Non-records are maintained for as long as 
administratively needed and should be removed from OLOL files and discarded as soon as the business use has 
terminated.  When removing or destroying non-record materials, take care that any documents which include 
“protected health information” as the same is defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. 1171 et seq. and regulations promulgated thereunder; documents the use of 
which have been restricted by contract; documents where usage might constitute an invasion of privacy; and 
any other documents which are sensitive are protected from unauthorized disclosure. 
 
Vital Records:  Vital records are records that are essential to the continued functioning or reconstitution of 
OLOL or facility during and after an emergency and also preserve the rights of OLOL or facility, its employees, OO-GN-031 
Page 3 of 58 
patients, and other constituent groups. 
 
E-Mail Communications:  E-mail communications, messages and documents transmitted by e-mail are similar 
to paper documents. They may be considered business records and are subject to this policy.  To determine 
whether an e-mail message must be retained and for how long, think of it like a paper memo or document.  If 
you would retain a memo due to its content, then you are required to retain an e-mail message of the same 
content for the same length of time.  The originator/sender of the e-mail message (or the recipient of a message 
if the sender is outside OLOL) is the person responsible for retaining the message.  E-mail messages may be 
retained in electronic form in the mailbox, or be printed and filed along with other documents related to the 
same topic or project.  Users may delete e-mail messages that they are not required by this policy to retain (such 
as non-record messages and transitory messages) and messages that are being retained in printed form.
