POLICY: 
Oxygen and other gases are potentially dangerous. Special safety precautions shall be followed at all times while using or 
storing oxygen. Personnel involved with the use and transport of compressed gas shall be trained in the proper handling of 
cylinders, cylinder trucks and supports, and cylinder-valve protection caps. All cylinder storage areas, outside and inside, 
shall be protected from extremes of heat and cold and from access by unauthorized individuals. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
GENERAL STANDARDS 
• Cylinders must be secured upright at all times so they cannot fall. 
• Valve safety covers shall be left on until pressure regulators are attached as applicable 
• Containers must be marked clearly with the name of the contents. Tanks with wired on tags or color code only shall 
not be accepted. 
• Hand trucks or dollies must be used in moving cylinders. Do not roll or drag cylinders.  
• For patient transport, cylinders must be secure while in route. 
• The use of oil, grease or lubricants on valves, regulators or fittings is prohibited. 
• Do not attempt to repair damaged cylinders or to force frozen cylinder valves. 
• No more than a total of twelve (12) full and/or partial e-cylinders or one (1) H cylinder may be stored in a non-rated 
room or area within a smoke compartment.  
• Any e-cylinder that is on a crash cart, patient stretcher, wheelchair or in a rolling holder (while it is being used for a 
patient) are considered to be “in use” and do not count against the maximum of 12 stored in a non-rated room or area 
within a smoke compartment. 
 
 FULL PARTIAL EMPTY STORAGE 
OLOLRMC 
Campuses (except 
Ascension Campus) 
• Walk-O2 Bout 
(+) or WOB+ e-
cylinders are 
considered to be 
“Full” when 
tagged with a 
green “Full 
Cylinder – Ready 
for Use” tag and 
gauge that reads > 
or = 2000 psi. 
 
• E-cylinders that 
have had the 
Green Tag 
removed but 
contain greater 
than 500 psi and 
stored in a rack 
labelled Partial 
are classified as 
“Partial 
• E-cylinders 
with 500 psi or 
less are treated as 
“Empty”. 
 
• Full and/or Partial tanks 
should be segregated from 
Empty tanks in areas 
labeled accordingly as 
“Full”, “Partial”, 
“Full/Partial”, or “Empty”. 
Oxygen E-cylinders in 
storage are not required to 
be individually labeled but 
must be placed in the 
proper secure rack or 
holder that itself is 
appropriately labelled. 
• It is acceptable for full 
and partially full cylinders 
to be stored together and 
marked by individual 
tagging as indicated by the 
internal gauge or group 
signage.

FLAMMABLE GASES 
• Special care must be used when gases are used in confined spaces. 
• No more than two cylinders shall be connected by manifold; however, several instruments or outlets are permitted for 
a single cylinder. 
  
PRESSURE REGULATORS AND NEEDLE VALVES 
• Needle valves and regulators are designed specifically for different families of gases. Use only the properly designed 
fittings. 
• Throats and surfaces must be clean and tightly fitting. Do not lubricate. 
• Tighten regulators and valves firmly with the proper sized wrench. Do not use adjustable wrenches or pliers. Do not 
force tight fits. 
• Open valves slowly. Do not stand directly in front of gauges (the gauge face may blow out). Do not force valves that 
stick. 
• Check for leaks at connections. Leaks are usually due to damaged faces at connections or improper fittings. Do not 
attempt to force an improper fit. (It may only damage a previously undamaged connection and compound the 
problem). 
• Valve handles must be left attached to the cylinders. 
• The high-pressure valve on the cylinder shall set the maximum rate of flow. Fine-tuning of flow shall be regulated by 
the needle valve. Shut off cylinder when not in use. 
 
 
PARTIAL OR EMPTY CYLINDERS 
• Partially filled or empty cylinders must be returned promptly to either the “Partial” or “Empty” storage area and must 
be properly secured.  
• Replace valve safety caps if applicable. 
 
 OXYGEN USE 
• Ensure cylinders are secure on rack and never hang anything on cylinder. 
• Briefly crack valves open to clear them before bringing tank into patient's room. 
• Read labels, tags and color code before administering any compressed gas. 
• Check oxygen supply regularly. 
• Always store oxygen cylinders securely.
