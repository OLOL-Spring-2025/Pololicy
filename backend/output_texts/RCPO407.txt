PURPOSE: Discharge Criteria will be developed for each patient to facilitate the evaluation of his or her 
progress toward discharge and to ensure that every effort is made for patient to be safe in his/her 
environment. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
 
1. Every effort will be made to ensure that the primary caregiver is the key participant in the patient’s discharge 
planning.  Family conferences, training, teaching sessions, and home evaluations, should all involve the 
primary caregiver.  Through these interactions with staff and patient, it is hoped that the primary caregiver 
will feel empowered to comfortably assume the role of “case manager” after discharge. 
2. It is important for the Case Manager to involve all professionals working with the patient in the discharge 
plans for the patient.  When appropriate these will include outside agencies that can ease the transition from 
Rehab. 
3. Adequate preparation for discharge requires early and active involvement of the patient, family, referral 
source, and other community agencies that will be involved with continuity of care. 
4. Patients will be discharged from services of the Rehab Center under the following conditions: 
a. The patient achieves the goals of the interdisciplinary treatment plan 
b. The patient refuses to continue therapy 
c. The patient is transferred to another level of care 
d. The patient is not making progress and there is no further benefit to continued treatment 
e. The patient is regressing and collaborative team efforts recommend discharge from service 
f. The physician discontinues treatment
