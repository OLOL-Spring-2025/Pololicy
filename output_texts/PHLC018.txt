PURPOSE: 
To provide instruction for the proper collection of ACTH Stimulation Test specimens 
 
Addresses: 
Supervisors 
Venipuncture Charge Techs 
Venipuncture Phlebotomists 
 
POLICY: 
A. Venipuncture personnel participate in drawing patients for ACTH Stimulation Testing by drawing a base line 
cortisol and (following a dose of cosyntropin) a one-hour cortisol level is also drawn. 
B. ACTH Stimulation testing with a 30-minute draw request: 
1. Is occasionally requested 
2. Is not considered part of the ACTH Stimulation Test 
3. Can be performed by having the appropriate personnel order a Cortisol 30-minute ACTH 
4. Time of draw is captured by the Rover device  
C. Patients are to be drawn in a timely manner 
1. Failure to draw in a timely manner can result in discontinued testing 
2. The physician will need to be notified that the test was discontinued and will need to be rescheduled 
D. The test may not begin until nursing personnel have the required medication on the nursing unit 
E. The test may be performed on Outpatients 
PROCEDURE: 
A. When the lab order is received to perform ACTH Testing, the Charge tech is to verify that: 
1. A correct order was placed 
2. The patient’s nurse has the medication on the floor before drawing the baseline 
B. Testing may be performed at any time without regard for meals 
C. Specimens are drawn in SST or Red top tubes 
D. Baseline cortisol level is drawn just before nurse gives the patient a loading dose of Cosyntropin 
E. Following baseline cortisol collection, the phlebotomist observers the administration of Cosyntropin to the 
patient 
F. The phlebotomist notifies the Charge Tech of the dose time 
G. If cortisol 30-minute ACTH is ordered, a phlebotomist must return to draw patient’s blood 30 mins following 
dose. 
H. For 60 Min Post ACTH, the patient must be drawn again at 60 minutes following dose of Cosyntropin (30 
minutes following the cortisol 30-minute ACTH blood collection) OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC
