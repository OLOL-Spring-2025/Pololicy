Distribution:                    Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Department  
 
Formulated By:               Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation, Cardiology Services   
 
Purpose: 
 
To establish guidelines for prescribing maximal safe exercise for cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation 
patients. 
 
To establish guidelines for exercise prescriptions which enhance cardiopulmonary endurance, body composition, 
flexibility, and muscular strength and endurance. 
 
Applies To:                      All Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Staff 
 
 
Policy: 
 
Prior to the development of a patient's initial exercise prescription, each patient will be risk-stratified into either the 
Low Risk, Intermediate Risk, or High-Risk category. An individual's risk stratification will be one of the measures 
used to develop and modify the patient's exercise prescription. 
 
The exercise prescription will designate the mode, intensity, duration, frequency, and progression of exercise to be 
performed by the Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation patient. 
 
 Mode:   The type of activity to be used. 
 Intensity:   The Target Heart Rate Range (THR) and functional capacity at which the patient is to be 
exercising. 
 Duration:   Number of minutes per exercise bout. 
 Frequency:   Number of days per week. 
 Progression:  How exercise prescription is adjusted in intensity, duration, and/or frequency. 
 
The Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Professional Staff have the authority to increase or progress the intensity, 
workload, or duration in order to maintain the patients' heart rate within the THR. Any revisions or updates in the 
exercise prescription during the course of the Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Program will be documented in the 
patient's progress notes, signed, and dated by the Professional Staff.  Parameters for General Exercise Prescriptions 
and Goals are described in the charts at the end of this policy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Procedure: 
 
CARDIAC OUTPATIENT ECG MONITORED (PHASE II) AND BASIC PULMONARY 
Mode  
Any activity that uses the large muscle groups for a sustained period of time and is considered aerobic in nature.  The 
activity must be able to be done while the patient is being monitored via telemetry, i.e., treadmill walking, bicycle 
ergometer, combination arm/let ergometer, arm ergometer, rowing machine, and/or resistance weights. 
 
Intensity  
The staff will use the estimated MET level of the patient in conjunction with information obtained from the general 
assessment, nursing assessment, exercise evaluation, and any other relevant information obtained during the patient's 
orientation and initial assessment period.  The Target Heart Rate Range (THR) is set by taking 50 -85% of the 
maximum heart rate (MHR) achieved on the exercise test.  The functional capacity is calculated at 50 -65% of the 
maximum MET level achieved.  The THR must be set 10-15 beats below any significant endpoints of exercise such 
as angina, ST depression, cardiac irritability, or blood pressure abnormalities.  If no pre-admission GXT is possible, 
the THR is set for 20 to 30 beats above the resting heart rate. The patient should consistently report an RPE in the 
range of 11-13. For Pulmonary Rehabilitation patients, the results of the 6 Minute Walk Test and Oxygen Saturation 
level should also be taken into account when determining intensity of the exercise progression. 
 
Duration  
Depending on patients' individual resp onses and conditions and risk stratification  duration should be gradually 
increased from what is initially determined to be appropriate to as much as 60 minutes as the functional capacity and 
clinical status improve. 
 
Frequency   
Three exercise sessions per week adding a home exercise program per Program policy and procedure. 
 
 Progression  
The exercise prescription is adjusted by the Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Team.  When the patient begins to show 
signs of conditioning the exercise intensity and duration are adjusted so that the patient remains within his/her THR.  
The duration is increased to program limits prior to gradually increasing the intensity.  The patient's RPE should 
remain in the light to somewhat hard range .  The THR may be adjusted by the Rehabilitation team according to 
reported symptoms.  The THR is generally increased in small increments (10%) according to individual patient 
condition.
