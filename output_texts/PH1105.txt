POLICY:    
Emergent Procurement of Medications 
 
PURPOSE 
In an emergent situation when pharmaceuticals are not readily available the pharmacy may obtain them 
from authorized sources in quantities sufficient to meet the immediate needs of the Organization. 
 
PROCURING MEDICATIONS IN EMERGENCIES 
Medications may be obtained from an authorized source (e.g., a wholesaler, distributor, hospital 
pharmacy, and community pharmacy) to meet emergency needs.  Procurement of medications from other 
hospital pharmacies and community pharmacies shall be within the limits of the Prescription Drug 
Marketing Act of 1987 and Regulations set forth by the FDA Drug Quality and Security Act Title II, The 
Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).  A buy/sell transaction record will be made. 
 
Pharmacy or facility personnel may be sent to the emergency supplier to obtain the medication.  If the 
supplier has delivery services (e.g., a community pharmacy or wholesaler) the delivery service may be 
used.   
 
CONTAINERS AND LABELS 
Medications shall be in manufacturer's labeled, original containers or in containers that are identified and 
labeled so that recalls can be affected as necessary and proper controls established.
