PURPOSE: 
Provide policy to insure proper communication and handling of specimens between the Operating 
Room and Radiology. 
 
POLICY: 
Needle localizations requiring Radiology will be handled according to the following procedure. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. Just prior to specimen being received by the circulating nurse, he/she will notify Radiology 
of the upcoming need for imaging.  
2. Upon receiving the specimen, the circulating nurse will label the specimen and complete all 
documentation according to policy.   
3. The specimen & patient labels are delivered to the x-ray tech in the OR or mammography 
department. 
4. Upon return to the room he/she charts the person the specimen was   given to (x-ray 
assumes responsibility for the specimen   at this time). 
5. The Radiology department is responsible for seeing that appropriate films are taken of the 
specimen and returning it to the circulator  
6. The Radiologist, as well as the Pathologist (if frozen section) will notify and communicate 
with the surgeon the results of both procedures. 
7. Once radiology has returned the specimen to the OR, the circulating nurse will then prepare 
the specimen for the ordered pathology exam (ie routine or frozen).
