Adult Intensive Care Capacity 
To accept and treat critical care patients from other facilities, OLOLRMC must have critical care resources available, in 
addition to standard MRI or CT functionality.  The flow coordinator office will utilize the following criteria to determine 
OLOLRMC’s ability to accept adult critical care patient transfers from other facilities.   
 
Red – (Unable to accept transferred patients, the only exception to this is a request for transfer from another hospital 
per LERN level I trauma designation, that requires a trauma surgeon to make the final determination to accept or deny a 
trauma victim). 
• One code critical care bed is currently available. 
• One emergency/trauma critical care bed currently available. 
• One emergency stroke/neurological emergency bed currently available. 
• Once the remainder of operational critical care beds are being occupied or reserved as outlined in Bed 
Reservation below the organization has met capacity red status. 
• No transfers out of the critical care units are planned for the next two hours.  
 
Notification 
Once the determination of intensive care capacity red is identified, the following team members will be notified: 
• Intensivists 
• Trauma MD 
• ER Physician 
• AOC 
 
*If capacity does not meet the red criteria list above, OLOLRMC is at capacity green. 
 
*During an emergency room surge, nursing operational leadership will discuss with the flow coordinator the need to call
