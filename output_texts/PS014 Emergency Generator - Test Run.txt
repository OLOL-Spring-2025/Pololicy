Revision Date: 03/20/2024 
Review Date: 03/20/2024 
Reference # PS014 Origin Date: August 1988 
 
POLICY: 
Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) Plant Services shall maintain, test run, and 
render to a state of preparedness at all times the Emergency Generator(s)  at any location where OLOL 
operates. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
 
Weekly No load Inspections : The emergency generator(s) will be  inspected & started for testing the 
initial startup and batteries.  This run time must be logged along with the below  information requested. 
The battery cells shall also be conductance tested for condition parameters & health of the batteries. 
 
The following information is recorded on each no load run: 
• Hose conditions 
• Belt conditions 
• Coolant levels 
• Oil levels  
• Fuel levels  
• Battery cable conditions 
• Battery voltage readings 
• Battery cold cranking amps, state of health, state of charge, internal impedance resistance. 
• Block heater working 
• Main breakers closed  
• Any leaks are repaired or evaluated for future scheduled attention. 
• Initial start is documented. 
 
Startup procedures shall include a pre and post run inspection. Actual start up shall be manual. 
 
Monthly Load Test: Plant Services shall test run the Emergency Generator under load conditions for a 
period not less than 30 minutes each month. 
 
Startup of generators shall be by simulated power failure. This power failure is caused by manually 
causing an outage on a single ATS switch which is rotated every month.  
 
Once the initial ATS swaps under load, all additional ATS (including any fire pumps) on the EPS are 
manually forced to swap load to the generator.    
 
The following information is recorded on each full load run:

• Transfer time (Under 10 seconds per code) 
• Current 
• Power KW/KVA 
• Voltage  
• Frequency  
• Coolant Temps 
• Oil Temps/ Pressure 
• Engine speed (RPM) 
• Cool down time (5min minimum) 
• Conductance testing of batteries. 
• Notation if generator meets 30% load. 
 
All discrepancies shall be noted on log form and be corrected immediately.  Any failures are corrected 
or Interim Life Safety Measure (ILSM) is implemented. 
 
Each generator inspection (weekly) and load test (monthly) is documented and kept in the hospital’s 
regulatory records.
