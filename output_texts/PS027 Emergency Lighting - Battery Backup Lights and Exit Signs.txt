Backup Lights and Exit Signs  
Revision Date: 07/03/2024 
Review Date: 09/30/2021 
Reference # PS027 Origin Date: January 2018 
 
PURPOSE: 
The purpose is to provide direction and responsibility on monthly and annual inspections for all exit 
signs / battery backup lights. 
 
POLICY: 
To ensure the safety of our patients, visitors, and staff during power outages and to ensure we are 
following the necessary NFPA and Joint Commission guidelines. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
Emergency lights are permanently mounted, battery operated lights which are tied into the building’s 
power grid. They draw power from the grid to maintain the battery fully charged. In the event of a 
power loss, the light automatically turns on, providing light for staff, patients, and visitors. 
 
Emergency lighting at Our Lady of the Lake (OLOL) facilities includes Battery Backup Lights and Exit 
Signs.   
 
Emergency lighting is used primarily as critical lights throughout all (OLOL) buildings. To provide 
additional safety measures for those in surgery, there is emergency lighting in anesthetizing locations 
such as operating rooms.
