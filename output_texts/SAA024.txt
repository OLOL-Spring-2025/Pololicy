PURPOSE: 
To provide guideline for safe delivery of anesthesia care in the presence of enriched oxygen and 
nitrous oxide atmospheres during head and neck surgery. 
 
POLICY: 
Safety measures should be employed in the presence of enriched oxygen and nitrous oxide 
atmospheres during head and neck surgery. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
A. The anesthesia provider should evaluate the need for 100 percent oxygen for open 
delivery during head/neck surgery. 
B. A FiO2 less than or equal to 30 percent should be used for open delivery, if patient 
tolerates. 
C. When possible, arrange drapes to minimize oxygen and nitrous oxide build-up beneath 
the drapes. 
D. In the presence of heavy facial hair near the surgical site, a water-soluble surgical 
lubricating jelly should be used to “coat” the hair. 
E. When performing electrosurgery or electrocautery in the head and neck area and 
including all laser surgery: 
i. All patients under general anesthesia will have their eyes protected with 
sterile water-based ophthalmic lubricant, taped closed, and covered with 
laser-appropriate moist eye pads/towels. 
ii. The anesthesia provider, depending on the site to be lasered, will use a laser 
shield endotracheal tube.  
iii. Supplemental oxygen (if concentration is greater than 30 percent) should be 
stopped at least one minute before and during the use of an electrocautery or 
laser, if possible.
