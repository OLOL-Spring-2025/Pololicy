PURPOSE:  
To assure that patients can receive an accounting of disclosures of Protected Health Information (PHI) 
when required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 
 
POLICY:  
A. Upon request, an individual will be given an accounting of disclosures of PHI in the six years 
prior to the date of the request. 
 
B. Exception: Accounting is not required for disclosures made― 
1. To carry out treatment, payment or health care operations 
2. To the individual of his or her own information 
3. For the facility director directory or to persons involved in the individual’s care or other 
notification purposes permitted under law 
4. Incidental to otherwise permissible disclosures 
5. For national security or intelligence purposes 
6. To correctional institutions or law enforcement officials as permitted under law  
7. As part of a limited data set 
8. Prior to April 14, 2003 
 
C. The right to an accounting of disclosures may be temporarily suspended upon request of a health 
oversight agency or law enforcement official, as provided by HIPAA 
 
PROCEDURES 
A. Providing the accounting: 
1. Requests for accounting shall be made to the Privacy Officer during regular business hours 
and shall be replied to within 60 days unless an extension of time is permitted under the 
regulations.   
2. Individuals will be asked to complete the Request for Disclosure Accounting Form 
(Attachment A). No employee shall refuse a request for accounting without the approval of 
the Privacy Officer. 
2. Except for those disclosures for which accounting is suspended, the accounting will include 
all Accountable Disclosures that occurred during the period for which the accounting is 
requested, up to six years prior to the request.   
3. Standard accounting items will include the date of the disclosure; the name and address (if 
known) of the entity or person who received the PHI; a brief description of the PHI 
disclosed; and a brief statement of the purpose of the disclosure. 
4. In the case of multiple disclosures to the same person or in the case of disclosures research 
purposes, consult the Privacy Officer for special rules that may apply.  OO-HIM-014

5. The Privacy Officer shall establish a reasonable fee for the accounting, as permitted by 
HIPAA regulations. 
6. The accounting shall be reviewed by the Privacy Officer before delivery.  The Privacy 
Officer shall delete any disclosure for which a suspension is in force.   
7. The accounting shall be delivered to the individual according to the delivery method 
contained in the request.  
8. A copy shall be placed in the patient’s chart. 
 
B. Suspending the accounting: When a health oversight agency or law enforcement official requests 
in writing that the individual’s right to accounting of disclosures made to it for health oversight 
or law enforcement purposes as allowed by the Privacy Rule be temporarily suspended, we will 
suspend the individual’s right to receive an accounting of that disclosures for the period 
requested.  That request shall be noted in the Accounting Disclosure system and must comply 
with HIPAA regulations. Consult the Privacy Officer for guidance.  
 
C. Documentation: The information required to be included in an accounting and the written 
accounting that is provided to the individual shall be retained for six years as required by 45 CFR 
164.5300.
