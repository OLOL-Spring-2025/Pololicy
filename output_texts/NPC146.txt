PURPOSE: 
This policy establishes guidelines for the replacement (exchange) of a suprapubic urinary catheter with 
 a mature tract.  
 
DEFINITIONS: 
When used in this policy, these terms have the following meanings: 
A. Suprapubic Catheter: A catheter inserted directly into the bladder through the lower 
abdominal wall for the purpose of short- or long-term drainage of urine into a urinary 
drainage bag. 
B. Mature Tract: The cystostomy channel through the abdominal wall to the bladder is 
considered mature once the initial catheter has been in place for at least 30 days. 
 
POLICY: 
It is the policy of OLOL that a suprapubic catheter may be replaced by a registered nurse (RN), with a 
physicianâ€™s order, once the cystostomy tract is mature.  According to the Louisiana State board of 
Nursing, this procedure may not be delegated.
