PURPOSE: 
To describe methods and timing for drawing samples required in glucose tolerance testing (GTT) 
 
Addresses: 
Supervisors 
Venipuncture Charge Techs 
Venipuncture Phlebotomists 
 
POLICY: 
Collection personnel participate in glucose tolerance testing by giving a proper loading dose of glucose and 
drawing patients at determined time intervals.  Glucose tolerance testing may be ordered for varying numbers of 
hours.  Patients are to be drawn in a timely manner. 
 
Before proceeding with the test: 
• Patients should be fasting for 12 hours before starting the test. 
• Patients should avoid smoking or drinking coffee prior to and during the test 
• Administer the test in the morning when possible 
• The fasting specimen is drawn before the administration of the Glucose Tolerance Beverage 
  
Glucose Tolerance Beverage 
• Beverage is kept in the Venipuncture department  
• Beverage can be served chilled or at room temperature  
• Contains 10 grams of glucose per ounce of Glucose Tolerance Beverage 
• Pour the amount of Glucose Tolerance Beverage required to make the glucose dose in a measured cup 
• Example – Required dose is 75 grams, then pour 7.5 ounces of the Glucose Tolerance Beverage into a 
measured cup and give to patient to drink 
 
PROCEDURE: 
A. Inpatient GTT 
1. Determine patient’s age and weight if under 18 years of age 
2. Determine the oral glucose dose (Glucose Tolerance Beverage) to be given to the patient 
• Non-pregnant adults older than 18 years of age the dose is 75 grams of glucose 
• Pregnant adults older than 18 years of age the dose is 100 grams of glucose 
• Children less than 18 years of age the glucose dose is weight dependant OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

o Give 1.75 grams of glucose per kg of body weight (1.75 grams glucose per 2.2 pounds of 
body weight) to a maximum dose of 75 grams of glucose 
o Give 75 grams glucose to children weighting more than 93 pounds 
o See Glucose Dose by Weight Chart at end of procedure to help determine glucose dose 
3. Greet the patient and identify yourself 
4. Identify the patient (refer to the Patient Identification Procedure)  
5. Draw the fasting blood glucose level before having the patient drink the Glucose Tolerance Beverage 
6. Take the glucose dose to the patient’s bedside 
7. Explain the test procedure to the patient advising to: 
• Not eat, drink, or smoke – may have small quantities of water if wanted 
• The drawing a series of glucose tests 
8. Measure the required glucose dose and give to the patient 
• Glucose dose should be drunk in a 15-minute time interval 
• Stay with the patient while the dose is consumed 
• May leave the glucose dose with the patient’s nurse 
• Time the dose was fully consumed begins the start of the draw intervals 
• Notify the Venipuncture Charge Tech of the beginning of the draw interval 
9. Patients are to be drawn on the hour for the time interval of the test identifying the patient each time. 
10. Draw priority is to be given to patients undergoing GTT 
 
B. Outpatient GTT 
1. Determine patient’s age and weight if less than 18 years of age 
2. Determine the oral glucose dose to be given to the patient 
• Non-pregnant adults older than 18 years of age the dose of 75 grams of glucose 
• Pregnant adults older than 18 years of age the dose is 100 grams of glucose 
• Children less than 18 years of age the glucose dose is weight dependant 
o Give 1.75 grams of glucose per kg of body weight (1.75 grams glucose per 2.2 pounds of 
body weight) to a maximum dose of 75 grams of glucose 
o Give 75 grams glucose to children weighting more than 93 pounds 
• See Glucose Dose by Weight Chart at end of procedure to help determine glucose dose 
3. Identify the outpatient (refer to the Patient Identification Procedure)   
4. Draw a fasting blood glucose before proceeding with the test 
5. Bring the glucose dose to the patient 
6. Explain the test procedure to the patient advising to: 
• Not eat, drink, or smoke – may have water if wanted 
• Drawing a series of glucose tests 
7. Measure the required glucose dose and give to the patient 
• Glucose dose should be drunk in a 15-minute time interval 
• Stay with the patient while the dose is consumed 
• Time the dose was fully consumed begins the start of the draw intervals 
• Notify the Charge Tech of the beginning of the draw interval 
8. Patients are to be drawn on the hour for the time interval of the test 
9. Draw priority is to be given to patients undergoing GTT 
 
C. Specimen Requirements GTT 
1. Container Type 
• Draw in gray top tubes – Gray tops are preferred because Chemistry can hold all gray top GTT 
specimen tubes and test at the same time OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

2. Labeling 
• Patient and medical record number 
• Must have the time of draw clearly noted on the sample label 
• Network ID code of person drawing 
• Cerner laboratory label for the interval of collection 
 
Limitations of Procedure 
Outpatients 
• Testing done during normal business hours – 07:00 to 17:00 
• Monday through Friday outpatients should be referred to the Plaza Drawing Station for testing 
• Saturday 07:00 to 12:00 testing may be performed on an outpatient status in the laboratory 
Inpatients 
• Testing may be performed as requested 
• Arrange test timing with nursing personnel to avoid peak phlebotomy demand periods 
Glucose Tolerance Beverage  
• Beverage is kept in the Venipuncture department  
• Beverage can be served chilled or at room temperature  
• Contains 10 grams of glucose per ounce of Glucose Tolerance Beverage 
• Pour the amount of Glucose Tolerance Beverage required to make the glucose dose in a measured cup 
• Example – Required dose is 75 grams, then pour 7.5 ounces of the Glucose Tolerance Beverage into a 
measured cup and give to patient to drink
