PURPOSE:   All respiratory therapists are to give verbal bedside shift reports to the RT assigned to 
care for mechanically ventilated patients on the oncoming shift.  Communication should allow for 
interactive participation to ensure the total, accurate, and current patient status is reported.  
 
PROCEDURE: The respiratory therapist will report to the on-coming shift all aspects of care for the 
patients in their area of responsibility to continue a seamlessly coordinated plan of care and medical 
management.  
 
The respiratory therapist reporting off duty will give a verbal bedside summary report of those 
mechanically ventilated patients they cared for on their shift.  This report will include all aspects of care 
required to maintain or improve the cardiopulmonary status of each mechanically ventilated patient.  
 
Bedside reports will be given and received in the assigned units (HVCU, SICU, TNCC MICU, MSCC, 
NCCU, and PCU). If the on-coming respiratory therapist has another area assigned with non-critical patients, 
they will receive the report on these patients before obtaining their bedside reports.  Additionally, when a 
respiratory therapist is assigned to take another critical care unit to balance the workload (i. e. Michael, take 3 
ventilated patients from NCCU), the primary therapist for that unit will take bedside reports for all 
mechanically ventilated patients on that unit. The secondary respiratory therapist for that unit will receive 
their report about their mechanically ventilated patients from the primary respiratory therapist on that unit.
