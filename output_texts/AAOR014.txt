SCOPE 
This applies to all Principal Investigators (PI) and the Division of Academic Affairs, which includes the 
Office of Research.   
PURPOSE 
To provide guidelines for determining which projects submitted to the Office of Research require 
execution of a Data Use Agreement (DUA). 
RESPONSIBILITY 
The Office of Research is responsible for withholding endorsement until a fully executed Data Use 
Agreement is received with project submissions that involve sharing Protected Health Information (PHI) 
when there is otherwise no formal research agreement between Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical 
Center (OLOL) and the PI.  The PI is responsible for facilitating the DUA between OLOL and the user of 
the data.  The Office of Research is responsible for approving and obtaining signatures on all DUAs.   
DEFINITIONS 
Covered Entity:  Under HIPAA, a covered entity is a health plan, a health care clearinghouse, or a health 
care provider who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA 
transaction.   
Disclosure:  To release, transfer, provide access to, or divulge PHI out of OLOL.  Disclosure also 
includes providing information or access to another covered entity or health care component for purposes 
other than original research for which the information was released.   
Individual:  The person who is the subject of the identified PHI.  
Data Use Agreement:  Written agreement between a covered entity or health care component and a 
researcher requesting a disclosure of PHI contained in a limited data set.   
Limited Data Set:  A subset of individual health information which has had certain direct identifiers 
removed, but does contain other PHI which could potentially identify the individual, and is used for a 
specific research purpose.  A limited data set is not considered de-identified data.   
Protected Health Information (PHI):  Health information transmitted or maintained in any form or 
medium which:  
1. Identifies or could be used to identify an individual, and  
2. Is created or received by a healthcare provider, health plan, employer or healthcare clearinghouse, 
and

3. Relates to the past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the 
provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present or future payment for the provision of 
healthcare to an individual.   
PHI Holder:  OLOL, the distributors of the PHI. 
Recipient:  The PI and their designee(s) listed in the DUA who will receive the PHI.   
Research:  The systematic investigation, including development, testing and evaluation designed to 
develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.   
Use:  To employ, apply, utilize, examine or analyze PHI originating from, belonging to, or maintained by 
OLOL.   
PROCEDURE 
Individual health information may be used or disclosed for the purpose of research as part of a limited 
data set when a DUA is in place between the holder of the limited data set and the PI.  Before obtaining a 
limited data set to be used in human participant research, PIs are required to request Office of Research 
project endorsement by submitting the appropriate documents to the Office of Research for review and 
endorsement.  DUAs are required when the OLOL PI is providing or receiving the limited data set.   
Creating a Limited Data Set 
All of the following identifiers for the individual and the individual’s relatives, employers or household 
members must be removed to create a limited data set:   
1. Names  
2. Postal address information other than town/city, state, zip code 
3. Telephone number  
4. Fax number  
5. Email address  
6. Social security number (last 4 digits only may be used)  
7. Medical record number  
8. Health plan number

12. Device identification/serial numbers  AA-OR-014 
Page 3 of 9 
 
13. Universal resource locators (URLs)  
14. Internet protocol addresses  
15. Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints  
16. Full-face photographs and comparable images  
Data Use Agreement  
A DUA must be in place between the holders of the PHI and the researcher who is the recipient of the 
limited data set before the limited data may be obtained or shared.  The DUA must contain satisfactory 
assurance the researcher will only use or disclose the limited data set for research purposes set forth in the 
DUA.  The researcher/data recipient is not permitted to re-identify or contact the participants with the 
disclosed information.   
The DUA must meet the following requirements:   
1. Establish the permitted uses or disclosures of the information by the researcher;  
2. Establish who is permitted to use or receive the limited data set;  
3. Provide the researcher will not use or further disclose the information other than as permitted by 
the agreement or required by law;  
4. Provide the researcher will use appropriate safeguards to prevent the impermissible use or 
disclosure of the information;  
5. Provide the researcher will report to the holder of the PHI any impermissible use or disclosure of 
which she/he becomes aware;  
6. Require the researcher to ensure any entity or institution to which the researcher provides the 
limited data set agrees to the same restrictions and conditions;  
7. Provide the researcher will not identify the information or contact the individuals; and  
8. Provide the researcher will attempt to cure a breach or end a violation unsuccessfully, disclosure 
of data to be the researcher will be terminated and the problem will be reported to the Office of 
Research.   
The DUA form is available on the Office of Research website.  Once the PI has provided the required 
information on the DUA, it will be forwarded to the Office of Research via email for verification of 
completion and required signatures.   
A DUA must be completed as part of an Office of Research submission when the following conditions are 
met:   
1. There is no clinical trial agreement between OLOL and the receiving party covering release and 
use of data;  
2. Disclosure of data in a ‘limited data set;’  AA-OR-014 
Page 4 of 9 
 
3. Disclosure is for research purposes;  
4. Individual patient authorization is not obtained; and  
5. As part of an Office of Research endorsed protocol.   
The completed DUA must be signed by a signatory official of OLOL, as well as the PI.   
In the event an OLOL PI conducting investigator-initiated research leaves the organization, continued 
access to the data may be appropriate as determined and endorsed on a case-by-case basis by the Office of 
Research Director.  A DUA is required if the PI intends to share the data with non-OLOL individuals or 
entities, or if the PI intends to access the data for a different research purpose.
