PRINCIPLE 
Quality Control (QC) is performed to ensure the proper functioning of materials, equipment, and 
methods in the Laboratory.  QC performance is defined and readily available to staff so that 
unacceptable results and trends can be recognized in order to respond appropriately.  All QC is 
tested in the same manner and by the same personnel as patient samples.  Each department in the 
Laboratory maintains specific departmental procedures for Quality Control testing.   
 
Quality Assurance (QA) is the systematic process of monitoring and evaluating various aspects 
of the laboratory to ensure that specified requirements are consistently being met. QA may be 
most referred to as “Supervisory Review”.  The Laboratory Quality Assurance program is under 
the surveillance of Laboratory Administration including Department Supervisors, Senior 
Technologists, Lab Managers, Lab Directors, Compliance Officers, Department Medical 
Directors, and Laboratory Medical Director.   
 
 
POLICY 
I. Quality Control  
A. Quality Control Performance 
1. QC should be performed as defined prior to beginning patient testing. 
2. Results should meet the defined acceptable criteria prior to beginning patient 
testing. 
3. When results fail to meet the defined acceptable criteria, corrective action 
should be initiated. 
B. Corrective action may include: 
1. Repeating QC 
2. Instrument Maintenance  
3. Switching QC or reagent lots  
C. All corrective actions should be thoroughly documented 
D. Supervisory Staff should be notified of failed QC as applicable to assist with next 
steps when QC failures cannot be resolved or when patient impact is suspected. 
E. Investigation of Patient Impact OUR LADY OF THE LAKE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

1. Certain QC failures may warrant a lookback to determine if there was any 
patient impact associated. 
2. Lookback can include: 
a. Repeating Testing once QC has met acceptability criteria 
b. Patient Chart review - may be performed if there is no viable patient 
specimen to repeat.  Patient Chart Review Form (LBA034-A) may be 
used for this purpose. 
F. If a test system becomes inoperable for any reason, the approved backup method 
should be implemented.  If the test system does not have an approved backup method, 
Supervisory Staff should be notified immediately to assist with deciding next steps.   
1. Testing may be referred to the closest FMOL Health System Lab if testing is 
available. 
2. Testing may be referred to an approved external reference laboratory. 
3. Significant delays in testing should be reported to Lab Administration, 
including Lab Medical Director, to facilitate appropriate communication 
with Hospital Leadership. 
II. Quality Assurance  
A. Laboratory records are reviewed daily, weekly, monthly, as needed, quarterly, or 
annually as applicable.  Laboratory Records include but are not limited to temperature 
logs, QC sheets, equipment maintenance, critical results notification/documentation, 
corrected results notification/documentation, error logs, recall notifications, 
intermediate test result forms, Patient Safety event log, and PI Monitors (see section 
III). 
B. Secondary review to verify completeness of records is performed as applicable and is 
performed by supervisory staff provided that they did not perform the initial review. 
C. Any control results exceeding defined acceptable limits that are discovered after 
testing has been completed should be evaluated for potential patient impact (see 
section IE). 
D. Inappropriate corrections to documentation such as over-writing or scratching out 
with multiple lines or squiggles should be noted as part of QA review. See also 
LBA033-Document Correction. 
E. Any deviations detected while performing QA review should be documented on the 
appropriate log or form and forwarded to Lab Manager and/or Medical Director for 
review as applicable.   
F. Recalls 
1. The laboratory will be notified of a recall through direct notification by the 
supplier/manufacturer, through Recall Manager software used by the Health 
System to disseminate recalls received at the system level, or both. 
2. Upon notification of the Recall, the appropriate department or lab will: 
a. Investigate for affected product 
b. Follow instructions provided by the manufacturer 
c. Determine potential patient impact OUR LADY OF THE LAKE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

d. Consult with Compliance Officer and Medical Director to determine 
next steps if necessary.  Patient Chart Review or Physician notification 
letters may be implemented. 
3. All recalls will be forwarded to Lab Compliance Officer who will report to 
Safety Committee and Quality Committee. 
III. Performance Indicator (PI) Monitors - PI monitors are elements chosen from throughout 
the laboratory spanning pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic phases of testing.  These 
indicators monitor activities critical to patient outcome, have the potential to affect many 
patients, or have been a recurring problem.  PI are monitored, compared against appropriate 
benchmarks, and are reported monthly on the Laboratory PI Dashboard.  Monitors that fall 
below acceptability criteria are addressed for overall quality improvement.  PI Monitor 
findings are reported to the Lab Quality Committee and Hospital PI Committee.

Affiliated Labs.
