PURPOSE: To define the pre-treatment process for soiled/contaminated endoscopes when reprocessing 
will be delayed. 
 
 
DEFINITIONS: Delay- Time frame allowing potential of dried biofilm formation. 
 
 
POLICY: All endoscopes in which reprocessing has a potential risk for delay will be encapsulated with 
Intercept foam per manufacturer IFU. 
 
 
PROCEDURES: 
 
1. Immediately after use, pre-clean endoscope and place into clear lined transport container. 
2. Ensure all buttons and valves have been removed from the endoscope. 
3. Attach waterproof caps where necessary. 
4. Invert and depress Intercept foam spray nozzle 
5. Apply foam to valve ports, biopsy inlet, distal end and suction port on the light guide connector. 
6. Follow the contours of the light guide and insertion tube until the entire can of foam has been 
dispensed and the endoscope is completely encapsulated. Use the entire contents of can of 
Intercept. 
7. Cover the container with red (biohazard) liner, then place hard lid. 
8. Transport endoscope to ENDO decontamination room along with completed Endoscope Use 
Form (time, date, user who applied foam). Place completed form into file folder 3 located on
