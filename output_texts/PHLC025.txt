PURPOSE:  A phenylketonuria (PKU) test is done to check whether a newborn baby has the enzyme needed to 
use phenylalanine in his or her body. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is needed for normal growth and 
development. If a baby's body does not have the enzyme that changes phenylalanine into another amino acid 
called tyrosine, the phenylalanine level builds up in the baby's blood and can cause brain damage, seizures, and 
mental retardation.  Testing should be obtained ideally between 24 and 48 hours of age, as close to 48 hours as 
possible.  Early detection enables the doctor to prescribe proper treatment enabling the baby to live a normal life. 
 
EQUIPMENT: 
Alcohol prep  
Gauze  
Lancet (heel stick device) 
PKU Form  
 Optional: Heel Warmer or soft warm cloth 
 
 
SPECIMEN COLLECTION PROCEDURE: 
1. Complete Specimen Card 
a. Have nursing staff accurately complete the entire form.  All demographic information must be 
completed, accurately and legibly before collecting the specimen. 
b. Before collecting specimen, verify correct demographic information on the form (filter paper 
card) and scan the patient’s armband with the Rover device and compare the information on the 
screen against the information on the newborn’s armband. 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Select the appropriate puncture area of the heel  
(refer to Phlebotomy Technique- Heel Stick Capillary Collection Procedure) 
 
 
 
 
3. Warm site with Heel Warmer or soft cloth, moistened with warm water up to 41⁰C, for three to five 
minutes.

4. Cleanse site with alcohol prep.  Allow the heel to air dry. 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Puncture heel with lancet (heel stick device).  Wipe away first blood drop with gauze.  Allow another 
LARGE blood drop to form. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Lightly touch filter paper to LARGE blood drop.  Allow blood to soak through and completely fill circle 
with SINGLE application to LARGE blood drop.  (To enhance blood flow, VERY GENTLE intermittent 
pressure may be applied to area surrounding puncture site). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. Do not layer successive drops 
 
8. Fill remaining circles in the same manner as step 6, with successive blood drops.  If blood flow is 
diminished, repeat steps 4-6.   
 
9. Give care to puncture site after specimen collection is complete. 
 
10. Allow blood spots to dry on a clean, flat non-absorbent surface for 3-4 hours.  
 
11. Form should be delivered to the Laboratory Referrals department for processing.

SPECIMEN REJECTION: 
 
Below are examples of blood specimens that are NOT appropriately collected: 
• Quantity Not Sufficient (QNS): The filter paper was removed from the drop before the blood  
   completely filled the circle or soaked through to the other side. 
 
 
 
• Specimen appears clotted or layered: Touching the same circle on filter paper to blood drop     
          several times. 
 
 
 
 
 
• Specimen exhibits Serum Rings or appears diluted: Not wiping alcohol from puncture site        
                      before making skin puncture. Allowing      
                                                                                                    filter paper to come in contact with    
                                                                                                    alcohol, hand lotion, etc.
