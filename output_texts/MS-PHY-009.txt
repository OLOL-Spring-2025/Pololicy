PURPOSE: 
 
The provision of quality patient care, as well as the orderly operations of Our Lady of the Lake 
Regional Medical Center ( Hospital), requires that all Medical Staff and Allied Health 
Professional Staff members conduct themselves in a professional manner and treat others with 
respect, courtesy and dignity.  Patient care may be compromised when inappropriate behavior 
or conduct disrupts the orderly operations of the Hospital, negatively affects the ability of others 
to deliver quality patient car e or interferes with the Practitioner’s own ability to deliver patient 
care in a competent and professional manner. 
 
The Hospital is committed to the principle that quality patient care requires cooperation and 
tolerance among all members of the health care team.  Therefore, disruptive behavior or 
conduct by a member of the Medical Staff or Allied Health Professional Staff will be addressed 
in accordance with this Medical Staff Disruptive Behavior Policy. 
 
The objectives of this policy are: 
▪  To ensure optimum patient care by promoting a safe, cooperative, and professional 
health care environment, to ensure Medical Staff and Allied Health Professional Staff 
members conduct themselves in a professional, cooperative and appropriate manner 
while providing services as a Practitioner at the Hospital. 
▪ To encourage the prompt identification and resolution of alleged disruptive behavior by 
all involved or affected persons through informal, collaborative efforts at counseling and 
rehabilitation that are intended to achieve any required behavior modification by the 
Practitioner; 
▪ To provide a formal procedure for the further investigation and resolution of disruptive 
behavior which has not been appropriately modified by prior informal efforts; 
▪ To provide for the appropriate discipline of Practitioners only after the informal efforts 
and formal procedures described in this Disruptive Behavior Policy have been 
unsuccessful in causing the physician to appropriately modify behavior in compliance 
with this Disruptive Behavior Policy. 
 
POLICY: 
 
For the purpose of this policy, disruptive behavior shall be defined as , but not limited to,  
behavior which: 
 
1. Constitutes acts of degradation, intimidation, or the threat of harm to patients, 
medical staff and/or employees of the Hospital; 
2. Interferes with the orderly operations of the Hospital; MS/PHY/009 2 
3. Interferes with and/or impairs the ability of others to accomplish their work safely 
and competently; 
4. Creates a hostile work environment;  
5. Interferes with the ability of others to function in a safe and competent manner. 
6. Adversely affects or impacts the community’s confidence in the Hospital’s ability 
to provide quality patient care. 
 
A single egregious incident such as physical or sexual harassment, assault, a felony conviction, 
a fraudulent act, stealing, damaging hospital property, or inappropriate physical behavior may 
result in summary suspension of the Medical Staff  or Allied Health Professional Staff  member’s 
clinical privileges. 
 
Examples of disruptive behavior and conduct include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• threatening, intimidating, or abusive language; 
• public use of profanity or similarly offensive language 
• inappropriate physical contact 
• sexual comments or innuendo 
• outbursts of rage or violent behavior 
• public derogatory comments about the quality of care being provided by the 
Hospital or other members of the Medical Staff  or Allied Health Professional 
Staff; 
• impertinent and inappropriate comments (or illustrations) made in patient medical 
records or other official documents, impugning the quality of care in the hospital, 
or attacking particular physicians, nurses, or hospital policies or containing 
threatening, abusive, profane, or derogatory comments or harassment of any 
kind. 
• Non-constructive criticism that is addressed to its recipient in such a way as to 
intimidate, undermine confidence, belittle, or imply incompetence.

participating in committee or departmental affairs.

observes, or is subjected to, disruptive behavior or conduct by a member of the Medical 
Staff or Allied Health Professional Staff  should immediately notify their supervisor , 
Medical Staff Services, or the Chief Medical Officer.   
2. Documentation of disruptive behavior is critical since it is ordinarily not one incident that 
leads to disciplinary action, but rather a pattern of inappropriate conduct. The incident 
shall be documented in writing by the individual making the report (see Disruptive 
Behavior Incident Report attached) and shall include: 
 
A. The date, time and location of the behavior in question and names of involved 
persons;

interview the Practitioner and/ or individuals who made and/or forwarded the report to 
obtain further clarification of the incident. Those reports considered accurate will 
continue through the following steps.  
 
5. The disruptive member of the Medical or Allied Health Professional Staff’s confidential 
Quality File will be reviewed to determine if there have been prior referrals involving a 
health concern or impairment or prior reports of disruptive behavior or conduct.     If the 
report is determined to be credible, the process for managing disruptive behavior will be 
followed.  
 
6. Prior to review, the Chief Medical Officer, Associate Chief Medical Officer, Chief of Staff, 
Associate Medical Director or designee may meet with the disruptive member of the 
Medical or Allied Health Professional  Staff.  The Chief Medical Officer or designee may 
request that another individual attend this meeting.  This initial meeting shall be 
designed to inform the Practitioner there is a concern regarding his/her behavior or 
conduct and clarify the incident. The Practitioner shall be advised of the nature of the 
incident, while making every reasonable effort to withhold the identity of the complainant 
and shall be given the opportunity to respond.  The disruptive member of the Medical  or 
Allied Health Processional  Staff shall also be advised that, if the incident occurred as 
reported, his/her conduct or behavior was inappropriate and inconsistent with the 
standards of the Hospital . The Chief Medical Officer  or designee will explain the 
disruptive behavior process and anticipated next steps.  
 
7. After review by the Professional Practice Evaluation Committee (PPEC) and/or MEC, the 
Chief Medical Officer  and/or designee will meet with the disruptive member of the 
Medical or Allied Health Professional Staff when possible . This meeting  shall be 
convened as soon as is practical.  The meeting shall be informational and collegial, and

shall constitute grounds for immediate exclusion from the Hospital  facilities; 
F. Advise that a summary of the disruptive behavior incident will be retained in the 
confidential portion of the disruptive member of the Medical or Allied Health MS/PHY/009 4 
Professional Staff’s quality file.  The disruptive member of the Medical or Allied 
Health Professional Staff may prepare a written response to be attached to the 
summary. 
 
8. The Chief Medical Officer or designee, with a concern for rehabilitation of the disruptive 
member of the Medical or Allied Health Professional Staff, shall have the authority to: 
 
A. Request that the disruptive member of the Medical  or Allied Health Professional  
Staff undergo a physical and/or mental health assessment; 
B. Request that the disruptive member of the Medical or Allied Health Professional 
Staff voluntarily refrain from exercising some or all clinical privileges until an 
assessment has been conducted, treatment completed, and/or an 
accommodation has been arranged to ensure the disruptive member of the 
Medical or Allied Health Professional  Staff is able to practice safely and 
competently; 
C. Impose conditions on the Practitioner’s clinical privileges until the behavior or 
conduct issues are further assessed.  Any restrictions or limitations of privileges 
will be in accordance with the Bylaws of the Medical Staff  and Allied Health Staff 
Policy 
 
The imposition of any conditions may be considered corrective action and hearing and 
appeal rights could arise pursuant to the imposition of any precautionary condition 
and/or limitation.  Notwithstanding, the Chief Medical Officer  may be required to report 
the imposition of precautionary conditions and/or limitations to the applicable state 
board, as required under Federal and/or State law. 
 
Although the procedures designated in this Disruptive Behavior Policy are designed to 
facilitate an informal and non -punitive approach to the management of disruptive 
behavior or conduct, this Disruptive Behavior Policy may be modified at the discretion of 
the Chief Medical Officer .  He/she may refer the incident, at any time, to the Medical 
Executive Committee. 
 
9. A single incident (or combination of incidents) of disruptive behavior or conduct that 
compromises, or appears to compromise, patient safety may require immediate action.  
Therefore, nothing in this Disruptive Behavior Policy precludes immediate referral, at any 
time, to the Medical Executive Committee or the Chief Medical Officer  for action in 
accordance with the Bylaws of the Medical Staff. 
 
10. In the event of any apparent or actual conflict between this Disruptive Behavior Policy 
and other policies of the Hospital or the Medical Staff, the provisions of this Disruptive 
Behavior Policy shall control.
