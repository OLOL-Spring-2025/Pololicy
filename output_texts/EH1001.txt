PURPOSE: 
 
The purpose of this policy is to describe the pre-employment health examination process that all job 
applications at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center  and its subsidiaries undergo prior to 
commencement of job duties.  This process ensures that all potential employees are fit to perform any 
job related activities, are free of any obvious or self-reported conditions which would pose a risk to one's 
self or to patients, and ascertain that they are not under the influence of controlled substances and/or 
abusing (prescription or over the counter) drugs. 
 
POLICY: 
 
It is the policy of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center that all job applicants prior to the 
commencement of job duties, be required to have a pre-employment screening which will include: 
 
 a. Completion of a pre-employment health assessment 
 b. Submission to a urine drug screen 
 c. A review of their tuberculin status - to be done in compliance with the TB skin test 
policy.  (See EH1002) 
 
Repeat examinations may be required by the Employee Health Department at any time to determine an 
employee's ability to continue to perform job related functions.  Job applicants, who are unable to 
physically perform job related functions and have not identified a disability, will not be employed if 
reasonable accommodations cannot be provided.  Job applicants will not be allowed to perform duties in 
the organization before the pre-employment screening process  is completed unless released on 
contingency by the Employee Health Department. T he Employee Health Department may request a job 
applicant to obtain a physician's release for fitness of duty or a second opinion pre -employment health 
assessment whenever it is determined that a condition may interfere with the applicant's ability to 
perform job related functions.
