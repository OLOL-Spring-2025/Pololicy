• Patient’s response to treatment 
• Any significant change in the patient’s condition 
• Any specific change in patient’s diagnosis 
 
Reassessments will be performed at the following time frames or under the 
following conditions: 
• when any change to a more acute level of care occurs (transfer to ICU 
from regular unit) 
• following any surgical procedure 
• when additional orders are received that are not a routine progression of 
the care plan 
• when any significant increase or decrease in status is noted by the 
caregiver 
• when a new diagnosis or change in diagnosis could alter the plan of care   Policy Reference Number

When reassessments are completed, the reassessment will address the following: 
• progress toward goals established on initial evaluation 
• changes in status since initial evaluation 
• changes in diagnosis 
• modification of treatment plan 
• modification of goals 
• continued educational needs of the patient and family 
 
New Physician Orders may not be required to perform the reassessment unless the 
original therapy order is cancelled or held.  If there is an active therapy order for 
treatment, the therapists may use their clinical expertise to make the decision to continue 
treatment, with any of the necessary modifications noted above.  The clinical decision 
may include input from physicians, nursing, and other consults.  All modifications to the 
Plan of Care will be documented in the electronic medical record.
