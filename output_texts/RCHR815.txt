1. Therapists are to enter charges into the computer system on a daily basis.  Procedure charges will be based on 
15-minute timed increments unless otherwise specified.  Those charges that are not time-based are designated 
as such in the system and should only be entered as one (1) unit per visit.

submitted by the close of each business day for record departmental statistics. 
3. The charge sheet will consist of a method to record number of patient visits, procedures, and time units of 
service 
4. Each day’s visits, procedures, and units are to be totaled at the bottom of the charge sheet.  Total units should 
be converted to 15-minute productivity units and recorded in the appropriate column. 
5. Patient charges will consist of PT, OT, and ST charges based on appropriate CPT coding.  Updates will be 
made to the Charge Master as needed by the appropriate team. All charge descriptors, coding, and pricing are
