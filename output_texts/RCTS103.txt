POLICY: Medical services are provided for each patient by a physiatrist, neurologist, or other physician 
qualified by training and experience and knowledge, to: (1) identify the nature and extent of 
functional disability and (2) to perform the necessary diagnostic examinations to detect or 
confirm pathological states that underlie, complicate, or exists concurrently with physical 
impairment and disabling conditions.  Furthermore, all medical information gathered is applied to 
their rehabilitation data pertinent to an individual when the plan of care is designed by the Rehab 
Center treatment team.  Each patient’s plan of care includes interventions designed to prevent 
complications, enhance recovery, and promote adduction to optimal levels of function, 
performance, and pursuit of personal life goals. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
Each patient that is referred to the Rehab Center will be evaluated by means of a complete history and 
physical examination by a physician associated with the Rehab Center.  This Rehab Physician, in 
concurrence with the referring physician, will recommend the patient’s disposition.  Should the patient 
prove a candidate for rehabilitation, arrangements will be made for transfer to the Rehab Center (see 
separate policy on Admission Criteria). 
Transfers will be coordinated by the Rehab Liaison, who will communicate all details to the Rehab 
Physician, referring physician, consulting physicians, and the patient and family.  The Rehab Physician 
will follow patients on other services who are candidate for admission to the Rehab Center but are not 
yet ready to be transferred.
