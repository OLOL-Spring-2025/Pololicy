SOP Manual: Blood Cancer and Cellular 
Therapy Program 
Section: Clinical 
Title: Care of the Immunocompromised Patient 
Date of Origination: 12/30/2024 SOP Reference #: CT-CLIN-122 
Revision Date:  Effective Date: 01/06/2025 
 
SCOPE:  
This standard operating procedure (SOP) applies to the Blood Cancer and Cellular Therapy 
Program (BCCT) located at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical. 
PURPOSE:   
To minimize the risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) for neutropenic and/or 
thrombocytopenic patients by establishing standards of care for the immunocompromised 
patient.  
Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 
or equal to 500 neutrophils per microliter. Patients may also be immunosuppressed after 
chemotherapy or when taking immunosuppressive medications (i.e. Prograf, Cyclosporine, 
steroids, Cellcept, etc.)  
This policy is to facilitate the care of these patients to prevent and rapidly treat infections and 
other complications.  
Thrombocytopenia is a deficiency of platelets (thrombocytes), which increases the risk of 
bleeding. Thrombocytopenia occurs when the bone marrow makes too few platelets or when too 
many platelets are destroyed or accumulate within an enlarged spleen. Bleeding in the skin and 
bruising occur. 
DEFINITIONS: 
N/A 
A. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE STANDARD OF CARE: 
1. Nursing Personnel Shall: 
a. Ensure neutropenic patients will have vital signs, including blood pressure, at a 
minimum every four (4) hours, more frequently if the clinical status indicates. 
b. Monitor vital signs using standardized measurements.  
c. The policy for first neutropenic fever will be implemented when a patient meets 
clinical criteria according to institutional guidelines. See OLOL SOP CT-CLIN-121 
Prophylaxis and Management of Toxicities of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
(HCT) and Other Therapies 
d. Daily weights, at a minimum, are to be done and documented in the medical record 
for any patient admitted to the Cell Therapy Inpatient Unit.          
OUR LADY OF THE LAKE 
 
 CT-CLIN-122

e. Twice daily weights are required for those patients admitted for high dose 
chemotherapy (i.e. transplant conditioning regimens) and whenever any medications 
are to be administered that are known to cause Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome 
(SOS), previously known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD). These must be 
documented in the medical record. A greater than or equal to 10% weight gain 
must be called to the on-call physician.  
f. Implement appropriate precautions for patient safety (i.e. Fall Program, latex allergy, 
chemotherapy, do not use extremity, etc.).  
g. Implement appropriate isolation precautions (contact, droplet, etc.) per hospital 
policy. For more information, refer also to Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) ''Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of 
Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings''.  
h. Adhere to the central venous access device (CVAD) policies and/or procedures for 
the care of CVADs, including guidelines for flushing and dressing changes. Refer to 
policy NIV-002 Central Venous Site Care.   
i. Administer intermittent or continuous chemotherapy/immunotherapy agents by 
following program/facility policies and procedures. Refer to policy NMO00-001 
Chemotherapy (Cytotoxic agents), Handling, Administration and Disposal. 
2. Individuals who live in a household with immunocompromised patients:   
a. Who are of age 6 months or older should receive inactive influenza vaccine or live 
attenuated influenza vaccine annually.  
b. Should receive the following live vaccines based on the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) immunization schedules. 
i. Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) 
ii. Roto virus (infants) 
iii. Varicella and Zoster 
c. Can safely receive the following vaccines for travel: 
i. Yellow Fever 
ii. Oral Typhoid 
d. SHOULD NOT receive active oral polio vaccine (OPV) 
3. Program personnel will provide education and, as available, printed materials to patient 
and family/caregivers on disease and treatment in appropriate understanding/reading 
levels. Education and materials provided will be documented in the patient's record.  
4. Program personnel will update the patient and family/caregiver on an ongoing basis of 
the plan of care for the patient, allowing and encouraging the patient and family/ 
caregiver to:

ATTACHMENT  2 Thrombocytopenic Guidelines 
Do you know how to appropriately use soap and water or an alcohol rub for 
hand hygiene? 
 
Soap and water 
When using soap and water to wash hands: 
Wet hands with warm water.  
Use warm, but not hot, water.  Hot water can contribute to skin 
irritation.  
Wetting the hands before applying soap reduces the likelihood 
of skin irritation. 
Apply soap. Use enough soap to give a good lather. 
Rub hands together vigorously for at least 20-25 seconds.  
You can use the "ABC" song and "Happy Birthday" to estimate 
20 seconds. 
Lather all surfaces of the hands and fingers.  
Do this away from the running water so that you do not wash 
away the lather.    
Remember to scrub between your fingers and under your nails. 
Rinse hands with water.  
Keep arms angled downward in the sink, so that water from 
your hands goes down the sink, not down your elbows. 
Dry with a disposable towel. 
Use the towel to turn off the faucet.  
Dispose of the towel in an appropriate bin. 
Alcohol rub 
When using an alcohol rub: 
Apply the rub to the palm of one hand.  
Use the volume of product recommended by the manufacturer. 
You should have enough to wet all surfaces of the hands. 
Rub hands together until they are dry.  
Be sure to rub over all surfaces of the hands and fingers. 
 
Do not wash hands after using an alcohol rub. This step is not necessary, nor is it 
recommended. 
 
*Note: Rubbing the hands together until they are dry ensures that the flammable 
alcohol in the product has evaporated and is no longer a fire hazard.

A. The following precautions should be implemented after the patient's platelets fall below 
50,000: 
1. Review standing orders for platelet transfusion parameters and transfuse accordingly. 
 
2. Avoid invasive procedures such as enemas, rectal meds, IM injections, or finger sticks 
unless ordered by an Oncology/Transplant attending physician.   
3. Consult the Transplant Physician before administration of any anticoagulant 
medications. 
4. Avoid medications that slow blood clotting such as aspirin or ibuprofen. 
5. Women who are menstruating should use sanitary pads instead of tampons.  
a. Nursing shall monitor and report how many pads are used per hour; saturation of 
more than one pad per hour should be reported immediately to the physician.  
 
6. Prepare the patient for a possible platelet transfusion. 
7. Implement fall guidelines and consider safety rounds for high-risk patients. 
8. Monitor daily platelet count. 
9. Hold pressure to venipuncture and arterial sites for at least 5 minutes and until bleeding 
stops. 
10. For critical bleeding, notify the physician immediately. Prepare patient to receive blood 
products and fluids. Monitor vital signs frequently and hold pressure to bleeding areas 
as appropriate. 
11. Provide the patient and/or family with the following instructions. 
a.  Avoid blowing the nose, picking the nose, or using decongestant nose sprays. 
b. Avoid straining while having a bowel movement. Avoid vigorous wiping after a 
bowel movement. 
c.  Do not use enemas or rectal suppositories. Utilize stool softeners to keep stool soft. 
d. Use a soft toothbrush or toothettes. Do not use dental floss or toothpicks. 
e.  Do not use razors with blades to shave. Use electric clippers and electric razors as 
necessary. 
f.  Avoid sharp objects such as scissors and nail clippers. 
g. Wear non-slip footwear when out of bed to prevent falls. 
 
12. Education will be documented in the patient’s medical record.

1. All patients will wear a standard surgical mask when out of the HEPA-filtered care areas and 
when being transported to/from unit for any reason.  
 
2. For patients with an ANC less than or equal to 500 neutrophils per milliliter and/or if they are 
on immunosuppressant therapy (including Cellcept, Tacrolimus, Cyclosporine, steroids, etc.), 
even discharged and readmitted, will wear a facemask outside of the HEPA-filtered unit, or 
until the attending physician releases the patient from needing to wear a mask. 
 
3. Masks must cover the patient’s nose and mouth to offer effective protection. 
 
4. All visitors are required to wear a facemask that covers their nose and mouth when in the 
healthcare setting in keeping with institutional standards. The number of visitors to a patient 
may be limited in accordance with hospital policies/protocols or based on the patient’s 
condition.
