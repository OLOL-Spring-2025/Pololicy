PURPOSE: 
To comply with the regulations taught by the Catholic Church & contained in Ethical & Religious Directives 
for Catholic Health Services. 
 
POLICY: 
It is the policy of the Pastoral Care Department that the following procedures be observed when the Sacrament of Baptism 
is administered. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. Notify the Chaplain. During business hours, the Chaplain assigned to the Children’s Hospital will baptize 
& should be called.  In the emergency room, operating room, and in any other life-threatening situation, anyone 
can & should baptize without waiting for the Chaplain.  It can be done by the doctor or by the nurse.  If the parent 
of the child requests the Chaplain to baptize, he/she should be called.  When the office is closed, the Chaplain on 
call should be notified. 
2. In all cases the Chaplain will be notified of all emergency baptisms, using the form Record of Private Baptism 
(see attached sample form).  Accurate records of all baptisms will be kept by the Chaplain in the Baptismal 
Register. The Chaplain in turn will notify the church office at St. Aloysius Church, Baton Rouge for all Catholic 
Baptisms and the church at which the parents are registered that the Baptism has taken place so that it will be 
recorded in the parish when the child is brought in to have the ceremonies of Baptism completed. 
3. Catholic premature infants weighing under five pounds who go to surgery will be baptized by the Chaplain (with 
permission from either or both parents) as a matter of policy. 
4. Catholic babies in the nursery who become critically ill should be baptized immediately by the any staff, with 
permission from either or both parents, unless parents cannot be contacted, if there is danger in waiting for the 
Chaplain.  For other Christian babies, the attending nurse should baptize if it is the wish of the parents & if there 
is danger in waiting for the Chaplain. The Chaplain or the parents’ pastor can also be contacted by phone for 
advice about how to proceed if time is a factor. 
5. The ordinary method of conferring Emergency Baptism will be as follows: 
      The person baptizing will pour water on the head (or forehead) in such a way that it will   
      flow onto the skin, and while the water is being poured, he/she must pronounce these  
     words audibly: “(Name….), I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy  
     Spirit.” (The same person who pours the water must pronounce the words.)  
6. For all other Christian children in critical condition & below the age of reason, the Chaplain should be notified, 
and s/he will take upon the matter of Baptism with the parents of the child. 
7. Under no circumstances will an infant be baptized against the wishes of the parents.  Catholic parents can be 
presumed to want the infant baptized if there is a life-threatening situation for the infant and the parents cannot be 
contacted. 
8. Other Christian parents can request that their child in critical condition be baptized.  When this occurs, the parents 
should be asked if they want their pastor called.  If time does not permit calling the pastor, or if the parents do not 
request it, procedures for emergency baptism and completion of the record of Private Baptism will be followed.

9. When the parents cannot be contacted and the baby is other than Catholic, the Chaplain, or the attending staff 
member will contact the family’s pastor or the administrator of their particular faith to learn what is customary. 
10. All products of conception, no matter at what stage of development (unless clearly macerated), must be baptized.
