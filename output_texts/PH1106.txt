PURPOSE:  
To describe the process used to notify pharmacy personnel of drug recalls, to result in immediate action and 
confirmation of action. Recalled drug products are to be returned to the supporting Pharmacy Purchasing area 
for consolidation and return to the vendor. 
  
INFORMATION: 
Recalls are action taken by a firm to remove a product from the market. Recalls may be conducted on a firm’s 
own initiative, by FDA (Food and Drug Administration)  request, or by FDA order under statutory authority. A 
Class I recall is a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a volatile 
product will cause serious health consequences or death. A Class II recall is a situat ion in which use of or 
exposure to a volatile product may cause temporary or medically reversi ble adverse health consequences or 
where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. A Class III recall is a situation in which 
use of or exposure to a volatile product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. 
 
Pharmacy Drug Recall Procedures 
1. The Pharmacy may receive recall notification via mail, email, or fax. 
 
2. The pharmacy leadership team or designees will ensure all storage locations and automated dispensing 
cabinets in patient care areas are free of the affected Lot or NDC (National Drug Code) of recalled 
product. Once identified, all affected inventory will be sequestered in the pharmacy.  
 
a. The pharmacy will be responsible for reviewing all inventory in any automated dispensing 
device it supports 
b. Clinic leadership at clinics that have purchased inventory from the pharmacy and do not have 
automated dispensing devices, will be responsible for reviewing supplies for recalled products, 
and taking appropriate action.

3. If it is determined that products affected by a Class I recall have been dispensed to patients, the 
designated pharmacy leadership will notify the following parties:

• Department chairs of all service lines affected (via Medical Staff Office) 
• Directors of Nursing

• Manufacturer 
• Product number 
• Lot number (if available)

corresponding action plan as appropriate 
6. All recalled drugs returned to the pharmacy will be separated from the rest of the inventory and 
marked as recalled. 
 
7. The Administrative Assistant or designees will maintain a hard copy file of all drug recall notices and 
the actions taken.  
 
8. For each recall, a file will be created containing the manufacturer's initial notice and attestation from 
pharmacy leader or designee that affected products have been removed from active inventory. 
Appendix II may be added to the file in the event that additional information is required.  
 
9. For Class I recalls, the Pharmacy Drug Recall Check List (Appendix I) shall be completed and added to
