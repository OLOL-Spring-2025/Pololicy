POLICY: 
As a Catholic healthcare institution, and in compliance with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic 
Health Care Services, T:\Data\Ethics Consultation\6th Edition to ERDs.pdf.  Our Lady of the Lake Regional 
Medical Center is committed to human dignity and believes in the sanctity of human life - from the moment of 
conception until death.  Despite the advances in biological and medical sciences and new technologies related 
to infertility, we do not presume that what is technically possible, is always morally right.  Reproductive 
technologies that substitute for the procreative, unitive marriage act are not consistent with human dignity.   
 
In accordance with Reproductive Technology Guidelines for the Evaluation and Treatment of Infertility, Our 
Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center does not participate in reproductive technologies or procedures 
which separate the unitive and procreative ends of the marital act.  
 
All requests for tissue derivation/collection (sperm, female reproductive cells, ovarian tissue, etc.) are to be 
referred to the OLOLRMC Ethics Team by placing an Ethics consult in EPIC or contacting the hotline for an 
Ethics Consultation Team Assessment (225-765- 7052).
