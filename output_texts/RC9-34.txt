PURPOSE: 
 The purpose of this policy is to outline the procedure for instrument/method comparison. 
 
POLICY: 
Comparability/Correlation of instruments and methods

III. PROCEDURE 
Children’s Hospital:  
 A.  Method Correlation  
1. Three times a year draw samples from two patients.  Sample will be obtained 
in a heparinized arterial syringe. 
2. Analyze blood sample on Radiometer blood gas instrument and EPOC blood 
analysis system then record testing results on the Method Correlation Log.  
3. Results will be documented in the appropriate spaces on the Method 
Correlation Log. 
4. The Method Correlation Log and result print outs will be submitted for 
laboratory director to review.  
 
Livingston Campus:  
A.  Method Correlation  
1. Twice a year draw samples from two patients. Samples will be obtained with 
one full lithium heparin (green top), one EDTA (purple top), and one sodium 
fluoride/potassium oxalate (gray top) vacutainer.  
2. Analyze blood sample on Radiometer blood gas instrument and print ticker 
tape.   
3. Immediately deliver samples to the laboratory for testing on the Abbott 
Architect and Abbott Ruby.  
4. Laboratory will test samples and printout the results.   
5. All results will be entered onto the Method Correlation log. The Method 
Correlation Log and result print outs will be returned to the Respiratory 
department and submitted for laboratory director designee to review.

3. Immediately deliver samples to the laboratory for testing on the Abbott 
Architect, Abbott Ruby and i-STAT.  
4. Laboratory will test samples and printout the results.   
5. All results will be entered onto the Method Correlation log. The Method 
Correlation log and result print outs will be returned to the Respiratory 
department and submitted for laboratory director designee to review.

5. All results will be entered onto the Method Correlation log. The Method 
Correlation log and result print outs will be returned to the Respiratory 
department and submitted for laboratory director designee to review.   
 
 
IV. RESULTS 
 A.  Instrument Correlation and Method Correlation  
1. All results must replicate within ±10% of each other except for lactate, BUN, 
and Creatinine. Lactate must be within one point of each other. BUN must 
be within ±, 3mg/dL of each other. Creatinine must be within 1 point of each 
other. 
2. Mean values demonstrating >10% difference between analyzers triggers 
an investigation and corrective action. 
3. If results do not replicate, immediately report to Blood Gas Lab Supervisor or 
Respiratory Director for corrective action and repeat testing.
