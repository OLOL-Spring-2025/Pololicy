Title: Pharmacist-Managed Warfarin Dosing Policy Reference #: PH-02-15 
Supersedes #:  
Date of Origination: 12/2011 Last Date Reviewed: 069/02/20241 
Last Date Revised: 11/13/2020 
 
PURPOSE: To provide guidelines to members of the pharmacy team for independently dosing warfarin 
when consulted to do so by physicians at Our Lady of the Lake main campus. 
 
For the purposes of this policy – Our Lady of the Lake Acension Pharmacists are not consulted for 
Warfarin dosing.  Acension Pharmacists may order daily INR levels upon initiation of Warfarin therapy.   
 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Pharmacists will monitor all patients receiving warfarin daily. 
II. Pharmacists will automatically adjust warfarin doses and order follow-up testing per protocol 
once a physician has consulted pharmacy to manage therapy. 
III. Pharmacists will follow patients initiated on the argatroban order set that have a consult for 
warfarin dosing. Once the physician specifies, pharmacists will initiate and adjust warfarin.  
IV.  A member of the pharmacy team will assume the responsibility for assuring the patient’s 
warfarin is dosed on a daily basis. 
V. Pharmacists will order baseline and follow-up INR levels as follows: 
a. Daily INR levels will be ordered until two consecutive therapeutic levels are achieved.  
Once two consecutive therapeutic levels are attained, INR levels will be ordered twice a 
week. 
b. For the treatment of HIT, INR will be ordered per the ‘Algorithm for the Transition of 
Argatroban to Warfarin’. Once argatroban is stopped, INR will be ordered daily until two 
consecutive therapeutic levels are attained. Thereafter, INR levels will be ordered twice a 
week.  
VI. Pharmacists will utilize the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee-approved warfarin dosing 
guidelines for this service.   
VII. Pharmacists will notify the consulting physician when: 
a. INR levels are > 4 (Exception: when patient is concomitantly on argatroban and warfarin)  
b. Any time clinically significant signs of thrombosis or bleeding are reported 
c. Any time they need further clarification of the clinical status of the patient 
VIII. Pharmacists will communicate their assessment and plan to providers via a progress note written 
within 24 hours of the consult and within 24 hours of any dose change, change in clinical 
condition, or addition of an interacting medication. 
IX. Medical record documentation will include an initial consult note and progress notes.  
Pharmacists should communicate any major issues to the consulting physician verbally before 
leaving a note.  Policy Reference Number

X. If a physician writes an order for warfarin on a pharmacist-managed patient without writing an 
order to resume dosing responsibility, the pharmacist will contact the physician to clarify who is 
managing the therapy. 
XI. Physicians will maintain all ability to order warfarin if desired.  However, they should write an 
order such as “Physician to manage/dose warfarin therapy” to indicate to the pharmacist that they 
are assuming dosing responsibility if previously delegated to a pharmacist 
XII. All patients receiving warfarin therapy will be counseled prior to discharge.  The anticoagulation 
education will address the following: 
a. Compliance with medication administration and INR monitoring 
b. Drug and nutrient interactions 
c. Potential adverse reactions 
XIII. Verbal and written information will be disseminated to the patient.  
XIV. Pharmacists will review INR levels of all patients receiving warfarin therapy, including those 
whom pharmacy is not consulted, with the ability to order INR levels when indicated.  The 
prescribing physician will be contacted when: 
a. INR is above 4 (Exception: when patient is concomitantly on argatroban and warfarin) 
b. Anytime clinically significant signs of thrombosis or bleeding are reported 
c. Dose adjustment is recommended

1 Note: patients who have been receiving warfarin during their hospitalization prior to pharmacy being consulted will be managed based 
on the nomogram whenever possible.  However, clinical judgment will be used to determine the most effective regimen for these patients.
