employees between the ages of 19 and 64  at potential risk of infection from a current measles, 
mumps, or rubella outbreak. This includes healthcare workers born before 1957. The vaccination is

All documentation of this vaccination program is maintained by Employee Health.

be offered the MMR vaccine at no charge.  The MMR vaccine will be offered after review of the 
employee’s immunization records, if available, and during the first week of Orientation or any time 
thereafter.  Employees, who originally decline to take the vaccine but later decide that they want the 
vaccine, may come to Employee Health for the vaccine at any time.
