IMPLANT RELEASE INFORMATION 
 
1. If you are having surgery which will result in the removal of an implant (such as, orthopedic devices, 
pacemakers, breast implants, shunts, etc.) and you request to have your implant returned to you after 
surgery, the following will apply: 
1a. Let your surgeon know prior to surgery that you would like to have your implant returned 
to you. 
1b. Sign an authorization and release form provided by Our Lady of the Lake. 
2. If the implant is defective or believed to have caused injury, it will be retained by Our Lady of the Lake 
until such time as legal disposition is determined. 
 
3. Once the implant is removed, it will be determined whether or not it can be disinfected or sterilized 
prior to release.  If your implant is unable to be disinfected or sterilized by normal means it will be 
disposed of. This is necessary so as not to cause undue risk to you or anyone else who may come in 
contact with the implant once it is released from Our Lady of the Lake.  Implants may be considered 
biohazard or infectious waste by some. 
 
4. If it can be disinfected or sterilized by normal methods, it will be sent to Risk Management. 
 
5. You should call (225) 765-8855 within 7 days after surgery, and arrange for pick-up of your implant.  
IF YOU DO NOT PICK UP YOUR IMPLANT WITHIN 14 DAYS AFTER SURGERY, IT WILL BE DISCARDED. 
I understand and agree to the foregoing.
