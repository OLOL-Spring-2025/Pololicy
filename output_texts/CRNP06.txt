Formulated By:         Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation, Cardiology Services 
 
Purpose: 
 
To establish guidelines for monitoring oxygen saturation levels of cardiac rehabilitation inpatients. 
 
Applies To:                  All Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Staff 
 
Policy: 
 
During the initial two reconditioning activity sessions, Cardiac Surgery patients are monitored by means of 
pulse oximetry in order to insure that oxygen saturation levels consistently remain in the acceptable range 
(asymptomatic, SpO2 80% or above). After the first two reconditioning activity sessions, pulse oximetry will 
be discontinued if the patient's oxygen saturation levels consistently remain in the acceptable range. However, 
the patient may be further monitored by pulse oximetry according to the judgement of the Cardiac 
Rehabilitation Registered Nurse or Clinical Exercise Physiologist, or by physician's request. The range of the 
patient's oxygen saturation levels are noted on the CIS chart within the Reconditioning Activity Session. 
 
 
Procedure: 
 
For the first two reconditioning sessions, each patient will be checked for oxygen saturation during the 
reconditioning activity sessions.  If Oxygen saturation levels remain consistently below an acceptable level 
during activity sessions, Cardiac Rehab staff will exercise the patient with oxygen available through nasal 
cannula at the level necessary to maintain saturation le vel within the acceptable range or based upon 
physician order for acceptable range.  If the patient is symptomatic or oxygen saturation cannot be maintained 
at an acceptable level during activity, the patient's floor nurse will be notified so that the patient's physician 
may be informed and additional direction given, if so desired by the physician.
