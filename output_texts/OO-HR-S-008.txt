PURPOSE 
The purpose of this policy is to provide reasonably predictable work schedules for employees while 
providing the flexibility necessary to meet patient needs. 
 
POLICY 
1. Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) generally negotiates regular shift and unit 
assignments at the time of employment attempting to accommodate the needs and preferences of the 
employee.   
2. The nature of hospital work, however, requires that OLOL Administration reserves the right to make 
changes in shifts and/or unit assignments within an employee's job classification. 
 
PROCEDURES 
1. All employees will be mobile within their departments as to reassignment on OLOL shifts or units.  
2. It will be the responsibility of department management or the supervisor on duty as to when and 
where an employee will work in the event of a greater need for staffing on a unit other than the 
regularly assigned unit.   
3. This will be as a matter of judgement by management as to the distribution of manpower on OLOL 
units to meet the objectives of patient care and work deadlines.   
4. Factors entering into this judgement will be staffing level necessary for optimum patient care, skill 
level required by the patient population, continuity of service, increased workload or emergency 
disaster procedures.
