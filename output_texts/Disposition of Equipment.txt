3.1.Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) – TRIMEDX 
uses RSQ as its maintenance management system. 
3.2.Covered Entity – Health care providers involved in the transmission of 
protected health information (PHI). This transmission can take place for 
the purpose of payment, treatment, operations, billing, or insurance 
coverage. Covered entities can include organizations, institutions, or 
persons. 
3.3.Decommissioned – A sub-status of the managed equipment record. 
Device is rendered inoperable and cannot be returned to service at any 
hospital/facility. 
3.4.Disposition – The deactivation of the device from the CMMS and physical 
removal of said device from the environment of care and availability for 
patient use at its current inventory location. 
3.5.Disposition of Equipment Form (DEF) – The form required to receive the 
HAA approval of the device to be dispositioned and to ensure the removal 
of PHI from the device if identified by HAA. 
3.6.Inactive – A sub-status of the device record contained in the CMMS 
defined as a device that is in operating order but is being removed from 
hospital/facility inventory. The device can be reactivated and used at 
another hospital/facility or reactivated at current hospital/facility with 
proper performance verification and equipment record updates. 
3.7.Managed (Covered) equipment – Any device, equipment or tool that is 
actively managed under a TRIMEDX contract by virtue of it being
