be set based on the Default Maintenance Program. (Refer to 
AEM and Default Maintenance Program Assignment Policy and 
Procedure)
6.2.Device Maintenance Program Setting: 
6.2.1. The CMMS database calculates a Device Maintenance Program 
for each device based on the following: 
6.2.1.1. The device's primary and secondary PM Schedule(s)
6.2.1.2. The AEM Schedule(s)
6.2.1.3. The MFR Schedule(s)
