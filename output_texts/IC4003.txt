PURPOSE: 
To state a plan for capturing infections, which may occur after discharge and could be considered 
healthcare associated. 
POLICY: 
Post-discharge surveillance of healthcare associated infections is a multi-faceted approach to attempt to 
identify and capture hospital-acquired processes which may occur after discharge. 
PROCEDURE: 
A strategy has been adopted to improve detection of hospital-acquired infections that occur in our 
surgical patients after discharge from the hospital.   
The method for detecting such infections is as follows: 
1. A questionnaire is sent to surgeons who do not use the hospital’s electronic medical record 
system and perform National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reportable procedures 
followed on Our Lady of the Lake Health’s monthly surveillance plan.  
2. The surgeon is asked to return the questionnaire listing any patients that develop an infection 
after discharge. 
3. The collected data will be reviewed and included in infection surveillance.
