Title: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) 
Policy 
Reference #: NCP-050 
Supersedes #:  
Date of Origination: January 1994 Review Date:  October 7, 2024  
Revision Date: December 13, 2021 
 
PURPOSE: 
To provide a method to assess the effectiveness of neuromuscular blocking drugs. 
 
POLICY: 
A. Patients on mechanical ventilation being treated with neuromuscular blocking agents in the critical 
care units shall be monitored with the peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS). 
 
B. Measuring PNS is needed to monitor the effectiveness of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBAs) 
so that clinicians can titrate the medication to the lowest dosage that is necessary to achieve a 
therapeutic effect.  
 
 
 Additional Recommendations: 
 
1. Body position is changed every 2 hours unless contraindicated.  Change in position is to be 
documented. 
2. Sequential compression devices or stockings are applied and documented. 
3. Bilateral heel boots will be used on all patients on NMBA’s. 
4. Pressure Ulcer Prevention dressings (PUP) will be applied to the sacrum of all patients on NMBA’s. 
5. Eyes are to be lubricated prn and/or closed to prevent corneal drying and abrasions.  Assessment of 
the eyes is documented every 4 hours. 
6. Sedation is given in conjunction with neuromuscular blocking agent.  Neuromuscular blockers do 
not provide for analgesic or antianxiety needs of the patient. Ensure the patient is placed on 
appropriate pain and anxiety medication.
