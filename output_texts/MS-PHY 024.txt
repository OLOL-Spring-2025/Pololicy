PURPOSE: 
To define and delineate the scope of telemedicine services at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical 
Center and to define the process by which a provider may apply for telemedicine 
privileges at OLOLRMC. 
 
As technology expands in the modern era of medicine and OLOLRMC continues to expand its 
departments and provider -based locations throughout the Baton Rouge metropolitan area, patient 
care has evolved to include the use of telemedicine services. 
 
DEFINITIONS:  
 
1. Telemedicine is defined as the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another 
via electronic communications to improve patients’ health status. 
2. Types of Telemedicine services: 
a. Asynchronous:  Term describing store and forward transmission of medical images 
and/or data because the data transfer takes place over a period of time, and typically 
in separate time frames. The transmission typically does not take place 
simultaneously. This is typically done without the patient being present. Examples 
include teleradiology services, teledermatology services and EKG interpretation. 
b. "Synchronous interaction" means communication through interactive technology 
that enables a healthcare provider and a patient at two locations separated by distance 
to interact via two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously. Examples 
include, teleICU services, specialist consults to other providers/facilities such as ED 
telestroke, specialist to primary care provider consult while patient is in the primary 
care or school clinic, and direct to patient consults outside of a clinic setting.   
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
Most telemedicine services at OLOLRMC are provided by current members of the medical staff to 
areas across campus, through electronic communications, such as the Mobile Virtual Critical Care or 
the Livingston Emergency Department. Through this model, OLOLRMC uses telemedicine services 
on its own campus by its own privileged providers.  
 
When OLOLRMC is the originating site for telemedicine services, all CMS conditions of 
participation and TJC standards must be met, including a mutual agreement between the distant 
hospital or entity and OLOLRMC, will be in place ahead of time. All providers applying for 
telemedicine privileges will be credentialed and privileged through the full process in accordance with the existing Medical Staff Bylaws , with exemptions for Article III, Sections 2(A)(4), 2(A)(12), 
and 2(A)(13), and the in person identity verification.
