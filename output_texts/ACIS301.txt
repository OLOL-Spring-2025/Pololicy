POLICY:  
 
Communication as well as eating, gives quality to life.  Therefore, it is the philosophy of the Speech-Language 
Pathology Division that each patient treated will achieve maximum independence in communication and 
swallowing within the limits of his/her ability.  Our service is committed to the recognition of the dignity of each 
individual and to maintain the highest standards of quality patient care.  The speech-language pathologist will 
inform, educate, and interact with the patient, his/her family or significant others and members of the treatment 
team to ensure optimal use of communicative and swallowing abilities.  The speech-language pathologist will also 
provide thorough information relative to the patientâ€™s initial status, progress, and discharge status to qualified 
individuals who will treat each patient upon discharge. 
 
It is the purpose of the Speech-Language Pathology Division to provide services of the highest quality, 
individualized to the needs of each patient.  Services include assessment and intervention relating to 
communication, cognition, and dysphagia. Included within the scope of services is education of family and staff 
and cooperative delivery of care with an interdisciplinary team of professionals.
