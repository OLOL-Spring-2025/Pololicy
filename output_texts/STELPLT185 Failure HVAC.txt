3.         Notify the Administrative House Supervisor.

following: 
  
a.                  Operation of fuel supply valves 
b.                  Malfunctions on the boiler control panel 
c.                   Boiler water level 
  
2.             If the boilers are operating properly, the temperature in the heat exchangers should be 
checked. If the temperature is not within range, check the temperature controls and correct. 
 
3.             Check the operation of hot water circulating pumps. 
 
4.             If the heating system failure is due to a boiler failure, refer to policy on Boiler Failure. 
 
5.             If the heating system failure if due to the failure of the hot water circulating pumps or heat 
exchangers, make the necessary repairs.   If the Plant Operations personnel are unable to 
identify the problem and solve the problem, contact the Manager of Facilities /designee for 
instructions. 
 
6.             Notify the Administrative House Supervisor and Administration/designee. 
 
Ventilation: 
  
1.              Check the fresh air and exhaust fans to assure that they are functioning properly.  Check the 
ventilation system for the following: 
  
a.                  Electrical failure 
b.                  Mechanical failure 
c.                   Filtration system for obstructions 
d.                  Fire dampers are closed and obstructing flow 
  
Should a failure occur to the central H.V.A.C. system (water supply, water chiller, and cooling 
tower) requiring a prolonged shutdown, then arrangements will be made for portable emergency air 
conditioning equipment to provide temporary services until the system is repaired. The House 
Supervisor and Administrator “on call” will be notified.  
  Note:    The ideal situation would be to pre-consult with the company of this type to insure 
adequate sizing and hook-up capabilities.
