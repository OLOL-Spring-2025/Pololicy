PURPOSE: 
To establish guidelines for patient transfers and admits in the presence of a shortage of available critical 
care beds. 
 
 
POLICY:  
A. The Intensivist and/or Medical Director will triage the patients out of the critical care units. 
 
B. For inpatients requiring transfer to critical care, if no critical care bed is available,  PACU accepts 
the overflow.  If the patient presents to ECU and there are no available critical care beds, that patient 
shall remain in ECU until a bed becomes available. 
 
C. The House Manager shall notify the Administrator on-call and the Medical Director of the Critical 
Care Medicine Service of the presence of ICU Capacity Red due to a shortage of available beds. 
 
D. In the event that a bed is not available in a given Critical Care unit for a patient who meets the 
admission criteria for that given unit, the overflow patient may be placed in another critical care unit. 
     
E. The on-call Trauma surgeon should be notified prior to admitting to the last empty bed in TNCC if 
the admit is not a Trauma patient.
