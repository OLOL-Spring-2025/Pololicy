PURPOSE: 
It is the purpose of this policy to define the correct procedure for correcting errors in the medical record. 
 
POLICY: 
It is the policy of the Health Information Management Department of Our Lady of the Lake Regional 
Medical Center that errors may be corrected in the medical record using acceptable technique. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
A. DOCUMENTATION ERRORS (see also Org Clin/008 – Documentation of Omissions and 
Errors) 
 
1. Do not attempt to erase, do not use ink eradicators (white out/liquid paper) or tape to cover and 
error on paper documents. 
 
2. Draw a single line with black ink through one word or single line errors; write the word “void” 
or “ in error” above the error and initial.  The full signature of the person initiating the error entry 
must appear in the chart for that day, otherwise, a full signature is required for the error entry. 
 
3. Draw a single diagonal line with black ink through a multiple line entry, write the work “void” or 
“in error” at the bottom of the entry and initial.  The full signature of the person initiating the 
error entry must appear in the chart for that day, otherwise, a full signature is required for the 
error entry. 
 
 
B. ELECTRONIC PATIENT RECORD DOCUMENTATION ERRORS 
 
1. Documentation errors made in the electronic record during the patient’s stay are corrected using 
the “Send to Document Corrections” process (See Hyland Onbase Document Corrections Guide 
and EPIC Chart Correction Guidelines). 
  2 
2. Corrections and additions are added to the electronic record using the “Epic Help Desk” button 
in EPIC.  The author/owner of the document is tasked with making the correction once notified 
of the error.  It is essential that the error be routed back to the appropriate person through the 
established chart correction process.   
 
3. Documentation errors and omissions/corrections that are noted more than 48 hours after the time 
the information was collected, but prior to discharge, require notification and approval by Risk 
Management and Health Information Management supervision before the correction is made in 
the legal medical record.  Staff must notify and obtain approval by their department management 
in order to initiate the correction process. 
 
4. Documentation errors and omissions noted in the hand-written or electronic record after the 
patient’s discharge will require approval by HIM Supervision and approval by Risk Management 
Director. 
 
 
C. ELECTRONIC ORDER ENTRY 
 
1. If an error is noted prior to the order being carried out, the incorrect order should be voided. 
 
2. If an error is noted after an order has been carried out: 
 
For single-event orders that have been carried out, the order is completed and no action may 
be taken to change that order.  The affected department should be notified to correct charges 
and documentation. 
 
 For ongoing active orders (i.e. with an ongoing frequency), the order should be voided.  The 
“void” action will remove any uncharted prior or future tasks related to this order.  The 
affected department shall be notified to correct charges and documentation.
