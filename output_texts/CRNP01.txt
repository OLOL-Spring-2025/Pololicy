Policy: 
 
Procedure for pre -admission of CVT patients was agreed upon by representatives of all of the departments 
involved (CVT, Outpatient Lab, Respiratory, Pre-Surgery Testing, and Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation).  
 
If possible, CVT representatives will make an appointment with Pre -Surgery Testing or Cardiopulmonary 
Rehabilitation for patients who are able to attend pre-admission education procedures before scheduled surgery.   
 
Pre-operative instruction from Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation for a patient may be available on request for any 
patient who has not been previously scheduled. However, Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation will meet that 
immediate request only if the department has available personnel to perform the procedure at that time. 
 
Procedure: 
 
The established procedure for pre-admission testing and education is as follows: 
 
If possible, the patient will be scheduled prior to surgery for a pre-admission appointment in the morning on a 
day during the week prior to scheduled surgery. Pre -Admissions Testing will contact Cardiopulmonary 
Rehabilitation for pre-operational education at when the patient arrives. A member of the Cardiopulmonary 
Rehabilitation staff will educate the patient at that time or at another mutually agreed-upon time.
