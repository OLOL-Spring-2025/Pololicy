1. Overview and Scope 
1.1. This policy describes the procedures for safely managing hazardous drug spills and cleanup in 
areas where Hazardous Drugs (HDs) are handled within FMOLHS Baton Rouge Market Pharmacies.  
1.2. A HD is considered spilled any time the HD is not contained in its intended container (including 
vial, bottle, intravenous bag, syringe, and other containers). HD spills can occur in any part of the 
lifecycle of a HD throughout the organization from receipt, storage, compounding, transport, and 
administration.  
1.3. HD spills provide a source of HD contamination to patients, personnel, and the healthcare 
environment. To reduce the risk of exposure to persons and the environment, swift recognition 
of a HD spill, notification to proper personnel, and all spill cleanup p rocedures must be followed 
to eliminate HD residue from the spill location.  
1.4. This policy refers to HD spill management of all HD active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), 
antineoplastic HDs requiring manipulation (beyond counting or repackaging), and other non -
antineoplastic and reproductive risk only HD dosage forms for which an Assessment of Risk (AoR) 
has not been performed. For HDs with an AoR, refer to AoR for spill management.  
2. Policy  
2.1 All local, state, and federal regulations pertaining to the disposal of HD waste are followed.  
2.2 Only personnel who have knowledge, received training, demonstrate competency in HD spill 
management, and are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) respond to 
cleaning a HD spill. Training is completed before being allowed to clean a HD spill independently 
and annually. Training is documented in SoleSource® Simplifi 797.  
2.3 PPE contained in the spill kits and worn when containing and cleaning a HD spill is approved by 
the DP, fit tested (if applicable), and donned and doffed per policy requirements in HD PPE policy.  
2.4 HD spill kits are located in all areas that HDs are routinely handled within FMOLHS Baton Rouge 
Market Pharmacies. The following locations are where HD spill kits are located: HD receiving, 
storage and compounding areas, and all locations where HDs are administered. 2.5 HD spill kits are commercially available with added facility specific items and each kit is able to 
absorb approximately 1000 mL of a HD spill or more. 
2.6 Spill kit expiration dates are checked monthly. 
2.7 HD spill kits may contain, but are not limited to: 
• Sufficient supplies to absorb a spill of about 1000 mL (or more if volume of 1 IV bag is routinely 
greater) 
• Signs denoting a HD spill is present and access is restricted 
• Multiple sizes of ASTM D6978 tested disposable gloves (medium or large size) 
o 1 outer pair (may be thicker utility gloves) 
o 1 inner pair 
• Disposable nonpermeable gown or coverall 
• 2 pairs of disposable nonpermeable shoe covers 
• Face shield 
• Chemical splash goggles to be worn with face shield (for full range of splash protection) 
• NIOSH-approved respirators 
o Respirators may only be used by personnel who have been trained and fit -tested to the 
appropriate respirator and use is dependent on spill size and type 
• Absorbent, plastic -backed sheets and spill control pillows (pillows are made of absorbent 
material) 
• Disposable towels 
• Sealable, thick plastic hazardous waste disposable bags (prelabeled with appropriate warning 
label) 
• One disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments 
• One puncture-resistant container for glass fragments 
• Required agents for deactivation, decontamination, cleaning, and disinfecting 
2.8 Contaminated personal clothing is disposed of as HD waste. Hospital owned/laundered scrubs 
are disposed of as HD waste and are not placed into the hospital laundry system.  
 
3. Roles & Responsibilities 
3.1 The Designated Person (DP): 
• Ensures personnel on the HD spill response team are trained, demonstrate competency, and 
maintain competency annually. 
• Ensures all HD spills have a corresponding fully completed HD Spill Report Form   
3.2 HD Spill Response Personnel: 
• Undergo training and demonstrate competency initially and at least once annually in skills 
and competencies related to all the procedures required to deactivate and clean a HD spill. 
• Adhere to all HD spill procedures and sequence of procedures based on the location of the 
HD spill, HDs that have spilled, and size of the HD spill. 
• Complete timely documentation of the HD Spill Report Form and report HD exposure to 
Employee Health if applicable.  
• Reports all HD spills to the DP and enters safety event into RLDatix®. 
3.3 Other Pharmacy Personnel: • Acknowledge initially and at least once annually receipt and understanding of  procedures 
required to recognize a HD spill, personnel to alert, and initial steps that must be taken.  
4.  Procedures 
4.1 Train HD responders with didactic and hands -on training demonstrations on the following HD 
spill management activities: 
• HDs handled at the facility and the risk of volatility associated with HDs  
• Determining size of the HD spill.  
o Small spill: < 5mL or 5 grams 
o Large spill: ≥ 5mL or 5 grams 
o Commercial spill kits contain supplies to handle a HD spill of 1000 mL or less. Two spill kits 
are required if spill > 1000 mL. 
o HD spills greater than 2 liters may require assistance from outside the organization.  
• Locations of all spill kits 
• Contents of spill kits 
• All PPE requirements for cleaning a HD spill, including knowing their personal glove size and 
fit tested respirator size (if applicable) 
• Respirator requirements: N95 vs fit tested full-facepiece, chemical cartridge-type respirator 
or Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) 
• Steps required to clean HD spill based on size and location 
• Required agents for deactivation, decontamination, cleaning, and disinfecting (if spill in a 
controlled area) 
4.2 Respirator requirements for HD spill cleanup: 
• Fit tested N95 respirators do not protect against HD gases, vapors, and provide little 
protection against direct liquid splashes. A fit tested N95 respirator is only worn to clean an 
HD spill when HD is not volatile at room temperature, the HD spilled is n ot powder, there is 
no risk of HD splashing, and the spill is ≤ 1000 mL.  
• A chemical cartridge-type respirator that is fit tested is worn when there is a risk of a volatile 
HD respiratory exposure, HD powder, a risk of splashing, or spill > 1000 mL.  
4.3 Train non-HD spill response personnel, who handle or work in the vicinity of HDs, on HD spill 
recognition and proper actions when a HD spill has occurred.  
4.4 Non-HD spill response training on HD spills include the following steps for proper action when a 
HD spill has occurred: 
• Determine if HD exposure has occurred and if required, seek treatment 
• Do not touch or walk in the spill 
• Contain or cover spill immediately, if possible 
• Remove themselves and others from the immediate area 
• Close door, if possible 
• Post sign that states “Hazardous Drug Spill: Authorized Personnel Only”  
• Call HD spill response trained personnel 
• Document on the HD Spill Report Form  
4.5 Spill Cleanup Procedure outside a Containment Primary Engineering Control (CPEC):  
• Post sign to limit access to spill area (if not already performed) • Determine the drug and amount (mL or mg) of drug spilled 
• Obtain and open spill kit. Ensure correct respirator, correct size PPE, decontamination agents, 
cleaning agents, and other supplies are present. Obtain any missing items.   
• Don PPE: back closing chemo gown, double shoe covers, and double HD gloves with the outer 
glove being the thick gloves contained in the spill kit. 
• Don fit-tested chemical cartridge-type respirator before entering the spill area. 
• Contain spill utilizing spill kit from area of least contamination to most contamination. 
o Place absorbent disposable towels on top of liquid spill, if not already in place.   
o Place absorbent disposable pads or towels that have been wetted with water (do not 
spray) on top of powder spill.   
o Using the absorbent towels, contain the spill and carefully place contaminated towels in 
HD waste bag.  
o Carefully remove broken glass with plastic push tool and dustpan then place into 
puncture-resistant container. Do not use any type of brush.  
o Completely remove and place all contaminated material in disposable bags. 
o Place container with the glass and the wipes with the liquid or powdered drug in a black 
RCRA container. Place all other waste is trace HD waste containers.  
• Clean the spill area with decontamination agent (followed by neutralizer if applicable). Allow 
area to dry.  
• Clean the area with designated cleaning agent. 
• Disinfect the spill area if spill occurred in a controlled environment used for sterile 
compounding. 
• Place all materials used for decontamination and cleanup into disposable bags. Seal bags and 
place in the appropriate final container for disposal as hazardous waste. 
• Remove outer gloves and place into trace HD waste container. Carefully doff remaining PPE 
with the inner gloves. Place all disposable PPE in trace HD waste container.  
• Decontaminate reusable PPE.  
• Remove inner gloves and wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
4.6 Spill Cleanup Procedure inside a Containment Primary Engineering Control (C -PEC) by 
compounder: 
• Compounding personnel stop compounding and notify any other personnel working in the 
area to exit and post sign to limit access to spill area. Ask exiting personnel to obtain help if 
necessary.  
• Cover spill with chemo prep pad(s). 
• Don additional garb from spill kit if necessary. 
• Do not turn off the C-PEC.  
• If the spill has penetrated the deck and the front or sash of the BSC/CACI needs to be opened, 
SRT personnel don fit-tested chemical cartridge-type respirator before opening front or sash, 
personnel without proper respiratory and eye protection leave spill area.  
• The C-PEC is not opened until the spill inside has been contained as much as possible.  
• Wipe items required for the cleaning spill with sterile 70% Isopropyl Alcohol (sIPA) and using 
appropriate technique, transfer items into the PEC. • For a powder spill, wet sterile absorbent towels with sterile water and place wetted towels 
on top of powder.  
• Place HD saturated wipes into hazardous waste bags from the spill kit. 
• Using a push scoop, clean up any broken glass fragments and place into a puncture-resistant 
container. Do not use a brush.  
• Clean the spill area with sterile absorbent towels wetted with sterile decontamination agent 
(followed by neutralizer if applicable). Allow area to dry.  
• If the HD spilled into the intake perforations of the deck of the C-PEC, open C-PEC and follow 
the same steps to decontaminate under the surface of the compounding deck. 
• If the C-PEC is a CACI, change the sleeves if they have come into contact with the HD spill.  
• Once the spill is contained and decontaminated, all interior surfaces of the C-PEC must be: 
o Surface decontaminated 
o Cleaned and disinfected with EPA registered one-step disinfectant cleaner and allowed to 
dwell for appropriate contact time 
o Wiped with sIPA  
• All wipes used for decontamination, broken glass, and the spill itself are disposed of in black 
RCRA containers. All other wipers used to clean spill area are disposed into trace HD waste 
containers. 
• If the HEPA filter has been splashed with HD liquid or powdered drug contaminates any 
portion of the HEPA filter itself, the C-PEC is taken out of service.  
o Place sign on the C-PEC stating, “Do Not Use – Contaminated with Hazardous Drug”.   
o C-PEC is not placed back into service until it can be serviced by a certified professional, 
replacing the HEPA filter if required.  
4.7 Treatment of personnel with direct eye or skin exposure to HDs: 
• Personnel call for help if needed. 
• Contaminated clothing is removed immediately and disposed in trace HD waste receptacle. 
• The affected eye is flushed with water for at least 15 minutes using and eye wash station 
• Wash affected skin with soap and water and rinse thoroughly. 
• Refer to drug-specific Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for additional first-aid measures 
• The exposure is documented on the HD Spill Report Form and a safety event is entered into 
RLDatix®.  
• Exposure is reported to Employee Health.  
4.8 Documentation 
• All HD spills are recorded on the HD Spill Report Form: Addendum 1.  
• HD Spill Report form is retained for 3 years. 
• HD spill is reported to DP and a safety event is entered into RLDatix®. 
4.9 Designated person conducts HD spill simulations 
• HD spill simulations ensure all non-HD spill response personnel perform required procedures 
for recognition of a HD spill initial steps to take when HD spill occurs. 
• HD spill simulations ensure all HD spill response personnel members perform required 
procedures for containing, deactivating, and cleaning a HD spill based on the size of the HD 
spill and location of the HD spill.
