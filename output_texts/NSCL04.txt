ENTERAL TUBE FEEDING & TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION 
 
 
ENTERAL NUTRITION 
 
POLICY: 
 
• The enteral tube feeding and oral supplement formulary is approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics 
Committee. Changes to the formulary will be initiated by the clinical dietitians and the Clinical Nutrition 
Manager. 
• There is no dilution of tube feeding formulas, either in the kitchen or on the nursing unit.  Any nutritive 
additive, such as Prostat, Nutrisource Fiber, or Juven will be purchased, stored and distributed by the 
Food and Nutrition Services Department and administered to the patient by the nursing staff as a flush. 
The closed enteral delivery system complies with HAACP recommendations.   
• Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDN)s monitor the nutritional care of all patients receiving enteral 
nutrition (EN). 
• Enteral nutrition is provided to patients by Food and Nutrition Services upon receipt of a RDN* or 
physician order. 
*RDN may place nutrition related orders per approval of  the Medical Executive Committee as 
outlined in Policy NSCL01. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
 
Physician/Registered Dietitian Nutritionist 
• Orders EN via the Epic electronic medical record for patients who have a functional gastrointestinal tract 
but are unable to orally meet their nutritional needs. 
• Specifies in the patient's medical record: 
o Name of enteral nutrition product. 
o Rate of feeding. 
o Feeding route (e.g., nasogastric, gastrostomy, jejunostomy, etc.). 
o Amount of water flushes. 
o Plan for advancement of feeding, including goal rate. 
o Order for modular supplements (Prostat, Nutrisource Fiber, Juven) 
 NSCL04 
Nursing 
• Follows hospital enteral nutrition policy regarding positioning of patient, medication administration, 
clogged tube and tolerance monitoring.  
• It is the responsibility of the nursing staff to store any unused tube feeding containers in the storage 
cabinet in the nourishment room. Closed, unused tube feeding containers do not need to be refrigerated. 
• The ready-to-feed container may hang up to 48 hours if the spike is not removed during that time.  Each 
time a new container is hung a new spike set is used.  If a tube feeding bag is utilized, the bag must be 
dated, timed, and replaced every 24 hours.   
• Modular supplements are administered as a bolus for enterally fed patients. 
 
Registered Dietitian Nutritionist  
• Assesses nutritional needs of the patient, monitors tolerance and efficacy of feeding; and documents in 
the medical record according to the established practice guidelines.  
• Executes directive of the approved protocol when RD to implement and manage feeds is ordered. 
• Assesses and documents the discharge needs of the patient on nutrition support and ensures a 
coordinated discharge plan. 
• An order for tube feeding is a  high risk trigger for a nutritional assessment, which will be completed 
within 48 hours. 
 
Food & Nutrition Services 
• Will provide commercially prepared enteral tube feedings. The tube feedings will be stored in the Food 
and Nutrition Services Department and distributed to the nursing units.  Tickets for tube feedings are 
prepared by the call center office.  All tube feedings are administered by nursing staff.  A closed enteral 
delivery system is used and ready to hang formulas are provided whenever possible.   
• Modular supplement packages will be delivered along with the ready-to-feed formula container. 
• The tube feeding order is received via interface from Epic to Cbord. The call center operator or Registered 
Dietitian will review the order in Cbord and adjust for any value changes if necessary.  
• Each morning the call center operator generates tube-feeding tickets from Cbord.  The labels provide the 
patients name, DOB, unit/room number, and formula.  
• Nutritional Services will check the expiration date, label and distribute a 24-hour supply of tube feedings, 
to all nursing units with the breakfast food carts. If the tube feeding is changed or needed immediately, it 
will be sent to the nursing unit throughout the day as needed. 
• Tube feedings are delivered seven days a week between the hours of 6:00a.m. and 7:00p.m. After-hours 
(after 7:00p.m.), tube feeding formulas will be available on a tube feeding cart located in Patient Care 
Services.  
 
BLUE DYE 
 
Based on expert consensus from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) 
February 2016 critical care guidelines, the use of blue food coloring nor any coloring agent should not be 
used as a marker for aspiration of enteral nutrition. Nutritional Services does not carry and/or promote the 
use of blue dye to detect risk of aspiration in enterally fed patients.
