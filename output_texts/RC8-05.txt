1. A physician order must be received to initiate extubation on all patients 
 with endotracheal tubes. 
2. Extubation parameters will be monitored and performed on patient prior to 
extubation.  When extubation protocols are ordered (SBT or ERT), the RT will 
follow the protocol and monitor parameters as listed in the written protocol. These 
parameters  include: 
a. Spontaneous tidal volume 
b. Spontaneous respiratory rate 
c. Heart rate

e. Minute Ventilation

Essential elements 
1. Place patient in semi-fowler or fowler position. 
2. Suction artificial airway. 
3. Suction the oropharynx. 
4. Pre-oxygenate patient with 100% oxygen. 
5. Deflate cuff and have patient inhale deeply (if applicable). At peak of 
inspiration carefully withdraw tube. Suction oropharynx as needed to 
remove all secretions. 
6. Place patient on the appropriate oxygen delivery device at the ordered 
FIO2. For patients on the oxygen protocol, follow the directions of the 
protocol. 
7. Draw ABG if ordered by the provider 
8. Monitor vital signs.
