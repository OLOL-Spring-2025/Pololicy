Serial Code:  CHMP-008 
  
PURPOSE: 
 
To facilitate the timely and effective management of infiltrations and extravasations. 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Infiltration: inadvertent administration of nonvesicant solution or medication into surrounding tissue 
Extravasation: inadvertent infiltration of vesicant solution or medication into surrounding tissue 
Vesicants:  an agent capable of causing tissue damage when it escapes from the intended vascular 
pathway into surrounding tissue  
Phlebitis:  irritation of the vein wall 
Warm compress:  is a dry warm compress which results in localized vasodilation and increased blood 
flow which facilitates drug removal from the area of extravasation.  Application of a dry warm compress 
for 20 minutes four (4) times per day for 1 or 2 days is generally recommended. 
Cold compress:  is a cold compress which results in localized vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow 
which restricts the spread of the drug extravasated and decreases pain and inflammation in the area. 
 
POLICY: 
 
A. Many non-cytotoxic (non-chemotherapeutic) agents have the potential to cause tissue damage if 
infiltration or extravasation should occur.  The severity is based on the dose, concentration, site of 
administration, and duration of exposure.  Hyperosmolar solutions and vasopressor agents often cause the 
greatest damage.  These agents may have an antidote that can be administered within specified time 
frame to limit tissue damage.  This policy is meant to guide the care team in proper management and 
minimize tissue damage.  The physician retains all authority over ordering and altering the medical plan 
based on clinical judgement.   
 
B. Suspect extravasation if the patient has the following signs or symptoms: 
1. Swelling, redness, blanching, blister formation, unexplained reduced IV flow rate, tightness, burning, 
pain or aching. 
 
C. Peripheral intravenous infiltration and extravasation documentation rows (PIVIE) will cascade in 
electronic medical record (EMR) when an infiltration is documented. The infiltrated/extravasated area 
should be measured and documented appropriately. These documentation fields can also be used for 
documentation of infiltration/extravasations with central devices.   CHMP-008 
Page 2 of 7 
 
 
D. Suspected or confirmed infiltration/extravasation should be treated immediately if an antidote is 
indicated.  See “procedures” for management below. 
 
E. When necessary, consult wound care.   
 
F. Surgery should be consulted for any concern of tissue necrosis.    
       
PROCEDURES: 
A. Immediate management 
1. Stop the infusion: At the first suspicion of extravasation, the drug infusion and IV fluids should 
be stopped. 
2. Do NOT remove the catheter/needle: The IV tubing should be disconnected, but the 
catheter/needle should be left in place to facilitate aspiration of fluid from the extravasation site. 
3. Aspirate fluid: To the extent possible, the extravasated drug solution should gently be removed 
from the subcutaneous tissues by attaching a syringe to the hub.  It is important to avoid any 
friction, pressure or massage to the area.  Aspiration of extravasated contrast media is not 
recommended. 
4. Do NOT flush the line: Flooding the infiltration site with normal saline or dextrose (5%) in an 
attempt to dilute the drug solution is not recommended. 
5. Remove the catheter/needle. 
6. Outline the site: Mark the extravasation site (using a surgical felt pen, gently draw an outline on 
the skin of the extravasation area).  Do not mark the skin for any neonate whose corrected ages is 
less than 28 weeks. 
7. Photograph: Photograph the area to identify progression or exacerbation or the tissue injury by 
following the Clinical Photography policy OC 055 Clinical photography of wounds and pressure 
ulcers and/or skin abnormalities.   
8. Determine extravasated medication and volume: Estimate the amount of extravasated solution 
that infused in the tissue and notify the physician at the time of the occurrence to obtain orders for 
treatment. 
9. Notify: Notify the house supervisor (as appropriate), provider, and parent/legal guardian of the 
event. Document in EMR that the parent/legal guardian and provider have been notified. 
10. Administer antidote: If indicated, administer the antidote (See Table 3). If the extravasated 
medication is not listed in the table, then contact the pharmacy department to determine if an 
antidote is needed. For the NICU, the physician/NNP will administer the antidote. 
11. Compresses: If indicated, apply dry compress to area of extravasation (either cold or warm, 
depending on vesicant extravasated) (See Table 4). 
12. Elevate: The affected extremity should be elevated above the level of the heart for 24 to 48 hours 
as directed by the physician.  
13. Document: Document the occurrence in the EMR under the PIVIE Assessment (Peripheral IV 
Infiltration and Extravasation) found in Flowsheets.  
14. Safety event: Enter a safety event. 
 
B. Extravasation Treatment Determination 
1. Prior to an extravasation occurring be familiar with the risk of each medication infused (See Table 
2). 
2. Once an extravasation occurs, refer to Tables 3 and 4 for the preferred antidote and compress 
recommended. If the extravasated medication is not listed, contact pharmacy for recommendations. CHMP-008 
Page 3 of 7 
 
3. In accordance with Table 2 if a extravasation occurs for a medication that is listed in the RED 
column and there is a known antidote, it is recommended to discuss with the provider and 
administer antidote as ordered. 
4. In accordance with Table 2, if an extravasation occurs for a medication listed in either the 
YELLOW or GREEN columns and there is a known antidote, it is recommended that the 
physician consider the percentage of extravasation and clinical judgement to determine if the 
antidote is ordered. 
 
C. Antidote administration 
1. Phentolamine (Regitine®):  Used for vasoactive extravasation and other medications as indicated     
(See Table 3). 
a. Treatment is most effective if given within 6 to 8 hours of extravasation. It should not be 
administered if 12 or more hours have lapsed from the time of extravasation. 
b. Retrieve prepared phentolamine (1 mg/mL) from pharmacy. 
c. Clean extravasated site with chlorhexidine (unless allergy is present, then use alternate 
antibacterial agent such as 70% alcohol or betadine). 
d. Use a 25, 27 or 30-gauge ½ inch needle and insert at a 15° angle, bevel up inject 0.5 mL 
subcutaneously in a circular pattern around the perimeter of the extravasation. 
e. Use a new needle with each injection. 
f. It may not be necessary to use all of the prepared phentolamine. The amount of the solution 
used will vary with the size of the area of infiltrated tissue. 
g. Erythema, pain, and hypotension may occur with administration. 
h. If the dose is effective, normal skin color should return to blanched area within one hour. 
 
2. Nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid®) 2% topical ointment:  Used for vasoactive extravasation and other 
medications as indicated when phentolamine is out of stock (See Table 3). 
a. Apply 4 mm/kg up to one (1) inch strip to the site of ischemia; may repeat every 8 hours if 
needed.  
 
3. Hyaluronidase (Hylenex®):  Used for extravasation of concentrated electrolytes including parenteral 
nutrition, mannitol, radio contrast media/dyes and other medications as indicated (See Table 3). 
a. Treatment is most effective if given within 1 to 2 hours of extravasation and should not be 
given after 3 hours. 
b. Preparation is dependent upon the patient’s age (See Table 1).

d. The antidote administered (if necessary) 
 
4. Document the post event site and extremity assessments for infiltration/extravasation >/= 60%: 
a. Create wound LDA. 
b. Document reassessment at a minimum of 4 hours after event. 
c. Continue to document reassessments at least once a shift until resolved. 
d. If there are signs of compromised circulation (evidenced by change in extremity color, 
decreased pulses, pain, lack of movement, swelling or tightness), neurovascular checks will 
be performed every 15 minutes x 4 then every hour until circulation concern has resolved 
and/or as directed by provider. CHMP-008
