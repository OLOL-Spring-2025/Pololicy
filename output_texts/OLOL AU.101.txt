PURPOSE  
To clarify the process of pathologist notification and responsibilities for various staff members 
involved in autopsy handling at service facilities.  
 
SCOPE  
This policy applies to laboratory staff, Pathology Group of Louisiana (PGL) employees and 
morgue dieners who participate in post mortem procedures.   
 
PROCEDURE 
Post mortem procedures are generally done between 8am and 5pm weekdays.  Requests received 
between these hours are transferred to PGL staff for appropriate handling.   Requests made 
outside of routine business hours are handled by the clinical laboratory senior technologist on 
duty and handed off to PGL staff the next business day.   
Deaths with Medical-legal Significance: Certain deaths that occur in a medical center are of 
potential medical-legal significance. These deaths may be referred to as Medical Examiner, 
Coroner’s case, Medical-Legal or forensic autopsies.  They must be reported to a local 
investigating agency. In such deaths, the Medical Examiner or Coroner may assume jurisdiction 
and is responsible for the performance of the autopsy.  
 
PGL only performs medical autopsies.   
 
PGL does not perform the following types of forensic autopsies: 
• deaths due to suspected suicide or homicide 
• deaths due to criminal means or by casualty 
• deaths due to drowning, hanging, burns, electrocution, gunshot wounds, stabs or cutting, 
lightning, radiation exposure, strangulation, suffocation or smothering 
• suspicious deaths 
• deaths in which poison is suspected 
• deaths due to trauma or deaths following an injury or accident 
• deaths in prison or while serving a sentence
