POLICY 
OLOLRMC Main and Affiliate Laboratories meets or exceed the regulatory requirements 
specified in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988 (CLIA -88), The 
College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Lo uisiana State Law .  The CAP urges 
laboratories to retain records and/or materials for a longer period of time than specified 
when such would be appropriate for education, quality improvement needs or as required 
by other accreditation agencies.  
 
If the lab should cease operation, these records will be transferred to the successor of the 
facility.  All records, slides, blocks, and tissues (if applicable) will be retained and 
available for the time frames specified in this policy. 
 
Specimens must be kept under appropriate storage conditions to maintain integrity.   
 
Documents will be stored in a manner that preserves legibility and protects from 
accidental or unauthorized access, destruction or modification.  Hospital EMR captures 
all patient tests performed by FMOL HS laboratories.  Referral lab tests not interfaced 
directly into the EMR are scanned  by Refe rrals Department staff  and are additionally 
filed for the required time frame.   Interim worksheets, QC records, and other 
miscellaneous lab documents are filed for the required time frame either onsite or offsite 
in safe and secure conditions through contract with Iron Mountai n.  Original Laboratory 
Records are not converted to other media for storage and retention. 
 
Records shall be legible and indelible.
