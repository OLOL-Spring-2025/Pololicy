PURPOSE:  
Establish guidelines for performing MRI exams on patients with MRI compatible cardiac 
pacemakers. 
POLICY:  
Screening: All patients who have an order for an MRI must be screened to determine if a MRI 
Compatible cardiac pacemaker is in place.  
For patients who have a cardiac pacemaker, the vendor may require a Cardiology Screening 
Order. The Cardiology Order requires a signature by the patientâ€™s personal cardiologist prior to 
scheduling of the study. If the personal cardiologist is unavailable, the ordering provider is to 
obtain the signature of an alternate cardiologist. At that time, it will be determined if the 
pacemaker is MR Safe or Conditional for MR Imaging based on manufactures recommendation.  
 
If a cardiology form is required it is reviewed by MRI staff, the clinical representative of the 
manufacturer is contacted to schedule the study. The MRI technologist will coordinate the 
scheduled study with the radiology nurse. 
  
When the patient arrives in the department, the clinical application representative or MRI 
technologist will directly, remotely, or with an IPAD, connect to the pacemaker and place the 
device in MRI mode for the duration of the examination. The nurse will be present to monitor 
the patient via cardiac monitor.  
These are guidelines and may vary based upon a certain clinical situation.  For example, patient 
requiring sedation, difficulty in obtaining cardiologist signature, or manufacturer requiring 
pacemaker is at least six (6) weeks post implantation.
