To identify the manufacturers reportable ranges, AMR and regulated analytes . The blood 
gas lab has established our Analytical Measurement Range which is posted in all blood gas 
areas.  These values are reviewed every 6 months as referenced in RC9 -10A.  Under no 
circumstances will our Analytical Measurement Ranges exceed the manufacturer ranges. 
 
Analytical Range as described by the manufacturer: 
 
pH    6.50     8.0 
pCO2   5.0     250 mmHg 
pO2    5.0              750.0 mmHg 
Na    85.0              180.0 mmol/L 
K    1.5                12.0 mmol/L 
Ionized Ca   0.25                4.0 mmol/L
