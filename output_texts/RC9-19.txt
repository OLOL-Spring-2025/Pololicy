PURPOSE 
The purpose of this policy is to delineate the steps followed to assure that the performance 
of the diagnostic testing equipment used in the blood gas laboratory is not hampered by a 
poor quality electrical supply. 
 
PROCEDURE 
A. The quality of the hospital's electrical supply is the responsibility of Plant Services, 
and is monitored in that department. 
B. Critical equipment is sustained on Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units, 
which incorporate power conditioning capabilities to avoid spikes, surges, power -
loss, and brownouts. 
C. The blood gas analysis units have surge suppression built in.  An in-line suppressor 
protects any equipment without integral surge suppression. 
D. Periodic monitoring of the electrical supply in the laboratory is not done unless 
there is indication of problems.  The performance of Quality Control on each shift 
is a more consistent monitor of the performance of the equipment than periodic 
electrical monitoring, and will detect any problem of sufficient level to affect 
performance.
