III POLICY 
 A. AMBULATORY PATIENTS 
Ambulatory patients who wish to access the outdoors may do so without a physician 
order but with physician notification unless contraindicated.  The House 
Supervisor/Charge nurse should be informed when a patient desires to leave the unit. 
It is preferable that a family member or visitor should accompany the patient for safety 
reasons, but not mandatory.  Access to the outdoors shall be restricted to the hospital 
campus. A vehicle is considered off campus. The nurse will advise the patient on time 
they are able to be off the unit. The patient must sign in and out with the nurse. The 
patient must remain in the designated area of the outdoors no further than the 
fountain in the front of the hospital.  
 B. NON-AMBULATORY PATIENTS 
Patients who are not able to stand and/or ambulate without assistance may access the 
outdoors unless their condition contraindicates it.  A physician order must be present 
on the chart.  The nurse must assess that this is an appropriate intervention in the 
nursing care plan. The patient must be accompanied by a House Supervisor, Nurse or 
CNA.  Access to the outdoors shall be restricted to the hospital campus.  
 
 
 
 
IV. 
C. INTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS 
Due to the critical nature of the ICU patient population at this facility, patients are not 
allowed to access the outdoors.
