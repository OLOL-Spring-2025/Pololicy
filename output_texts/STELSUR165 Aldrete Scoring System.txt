Aldrete Scoring System

I. PURPOSE 
1. To provide a guideline for evaluating the progress of the post anesthesia 
patient or the patient who receives Sedation Analgesia. 
2. To provide a set criteria for discharge from the recovery phase of anesthesia 
or Sedation Analgesia. 
3. To define physiological criteria that must be met for safe patient discharge. 
  
II. APPLIES TO 
Surgical Services, Critical Care Units, and Emergency Room 
 
III. POLICY 
1. The Aldrete Scoring System shall be utilized as written discharge criteria for 
discharging patients from Phase I post anesthesia recovery or Sedation 
Analgesia. 
2. All post anesthesia or Sedation Analgesia patients shall be scored relative to 
that patient’s preoperative condition using the Aldrete Scoring System. 
 
IV. PROCEDURE 
The Aldrete Scoring System consists of the following (SEE ATTACHMENT): 
1. ACTIVITY: Motion of all extremities. It is assessed by observing the ability 
of the patient to move their extremities spontaneously or on command. 
a. For patients with regionals blocks, activity should be assessed prior to 
the procedure and compared postoperatively. 
b. Exceptions: chronically debilitated, paralyzed, or dementia-stricken 
patients are treated individually, and scoring should be reflected as 
appropriate to their baseline. 
2. RESPIRATION: Ability of the patient to maintain a stable airway with effort 
of breathing. 
3. CIRCULATION: It is difficult to evaluate by any simple method. Changes in 
the systolic blood pressure from the pre-anesthesia level were chosen because 
blood pressure is usually monitored throughout the anesthetic period. 
a. Blood pressure should be maintained at an acceptable level prior to 
discharge. 
4. CONSCIOUSNESS: Ability of the patient to respond to verbal command 
through simple questions.  2 
a. Preoperative level of consciousness should be evaluated and 
compared prior to documentation. 
5. OXYGEN SATURATION: Ability of the patient to maintain oxygen 
saturation according to the pulse oximetry monitor that should be recorded. 
 
Additional comments: 
1. Aldrete Scoring System should be evaluated and documented: 
a. First upon admission to post procedural area 
b. Next every 5 minutes for the first 15 minutes 
c. Then every 15 minutes for the first hour 
d. Lastly, every 1 hour until discharge 
2. Nursing judgement must be utilized since this system is not infallible. 
3. No zeros should be reflected in any category unless confirmed by the 
physician.  
4. The patient should have a minimum score of 8 or higher for discharge to the 
inpatient floor or home. Exceptions include patients returning to surgery or 
ICU placement with an ordered placed by the physician. 
5. The physician should be notified and consulted if decrease in Aldrete Scoring 
continues after interventions have been made. 
6. Variable that may influence the patient’s emergence from anesthesia include: 
a. Type of anesthetic agent 
b. Use of paralyzing drugs and/or narcotics during surgery 
c. Type of surgery performed  
d. Duration of surgery and anesthesia

Aldrete Score Scale (Adult) Scoring  
  
Moves Extremities  2=moves 4 extremities or movement has returned to baseline if deficit exists 
 1=moves 2 extremities  
 0=moves 0 extremities  
  
Respiratory Effort 2=deep breath/coughs freely without apparent difficulty 
 
1=dyspnea or limited breathing. Patient is breathing spontaneously but effort 
is limited. Requires supportive measures to maintain airway patency (oral 
airways, nasal trumpets, ET tubes) 
 0=apnea. No spontaneous effort is evident. Requires assisted ventilation. 
  
Preanesthesia BP 2=systolic BP +/- 20mmHg of pre-anesthetic level 
 1=systolic BP +/- 20-50mmHg pre-anesthetic level 
 0=systolic BP +/- 50mmHg pre-anesthetic level 
  
Arousability  2=fully awake and alert. Able to answer questions. 
 1=arousable on calling. Responses easily to verbal commands. 
 
0=not responding. Auditory stimuli fails to illicit any response. No painful 
stimuli should be used to elicit a response. 
  
SaO2  2=SaO2 ≥ 92% on room air 
 
1=SaO2 > 90% on O2. Includes while on devices such as BIPAP/CPAP, T-piece, 
ET tube ventilation 
 0=SaO2 < 90% on O2  4
