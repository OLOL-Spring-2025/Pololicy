PRINCIPLE: AL

The Low Range Activated Clotting Time (ACT-LR) measures time taken for the formation of a
fibrin clot. Fresh whole blood is added to an activator (the ACT-LR test uses a mixture of Celite,
potato dextrin, stabilizers and buffers), which is contained in a disposable single-use cuvette.

The type of activator used will affect the degree of prolongation of the ACT to a given heparin
dose.

The Hemochron Signature Elite is a battery-operated hand-held instrument that performs
individual point of care coagulation test on fresh or citrated whole blood. Once sample is added
and test has started, the instrument measures the required volume of blood and automatically
moves it into the cuvette test channel, where it is mixed with reagents. The remainder of the
blood sample, not needed for testing, is automatically drawn out of the sample well and into the
enclosed waste channel of the cuvette. After mixing with the reagent, the sample is moved back
and forth within the test channel and monitored for clot formation. The test channel is maintained
at 37°C £ 1.0°C during the test. When the blood clots, the flow of the blood sample within the
test channel is impeded, reducing its rate of flow between the LED optical detectors. The
instrument recognizes that the clot endpoint has been achieved when the movement decreases
below a predetermined rate. ~ An internal timer measures the elapsed time between the start of

the test and the clot formation. The Celite equivalent ACT value in seconds, is reported as the
Activated Clotting Time.

This test demonstrates linear correlation to the anticoagulation effects of heparin concentrations
up to 2.5 units/ml of blood. The ACT-LR test cartridge should not be used for patient testing
during procedures requiring heparinization at levels greater than 2.5 units/ml.

PURPOSE:

The ACT-LR is used to monitor the clinical effect of low — moderate heparin doses frequently
associated with patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, hemodialysis, extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation, and other special procedures. It is also used by the lab, to monitor
patients who are no longer receiving heparin and have completed mentioned procedures. Close
monitoring and control of anticoagulation is desirable to ensure clot free blood flow while
minimizing bleeding complications following the procedure. Activated Clotting Time testing at
the point of care site is intended to provide rapid assessment of the magnitude of the
anticoagulant effect of heparin.

Refer to Job Aide (POCT03-J4-1) for quick reference of policy and procedure.

SPECIMEN COLLECTION, HANDLING AND REJECTION CRITERIA:
SPECIMEN COLLECTION:

Before collecting specimen, verify patient identity by using two patient identifiers.
Approximately 0.2 ml of fresh whole blood is necessary for a single ACT test. Testing should
proceed immediately following sample collection. Improperly handled samples can yield
erroneous test results.
L. Extracorporeal circulation (patients on pump): Using manifold, withdraw patient
blood into the syringe and flush several times then draw the sample. Proceed with
testing.

2. Anti-coagulated lines: Flush the line thoroughly. Clear the lines of heparin by
withdrawing 10-15cc of blood from the line being used to obtain the sample. This
sample contains residual heparin and is to be discarded. Collect the patient test
sample with a second syringe. Proceed with testing.

3. Indwelling catheters: Using sheath, aspirate 10-15ccs of blood into the syringe and
discard, then draw sample from the sampling port into a second syringe. Proceed
with testing.

SPECIMEN REJECTION:

1. Samples drawn from an indwelling line contaminated with line fluids due to inadequate
flushing before sampling.

Samples drawn in a syringe containing heparin

Samples drawn from heparin line

Samples drawn in a glass syringe

. Samples drawn but not tested immediately

QUALITY CONTROLS:

SELF-CHECK:
The Hemochron Elite instrument performs a “self-check” every time it is activated, and a
test is performed. When a test is initiated by inserting a cuvette, system checks are
automatically performed and include:

a. Verification of adequate battery power to complete a full test.

b. Verification of the test type on the screen display to ensure that the LEDs used for
identifying the test are functioning properly.

¢. Verification that the cuvette temperature is warmed to 37°C £ 1.0°C. If this
temperature is not achieved or is exceeded, an appropriate error message will be
displayed, and testing is prohibited. Contact POCT Department for assistance.

d. Verification that the sample is present and is of sufficient quantity to run test. If
not, the test is terminated, and an error message displayed.

e. Verification that the internal timers function correctly for each test. If the system
timer and assay timer disagree, a real-time clock error message is displayed and
the test result is not reported.

Verification of Instrument T emperature:
Instrument temperature is automatically checked whenever EQC is carried out. The
Instrument temperature check verifies that a temperature of 37°C =+ 1.0°C is maintained
during testing.

Quality Control Performance:
1. The quality control procedures are to be performed by, and rotated among, all testing
personnel who perform patient testing.
2. Quality Control procedures monitor instrument function, test cuvette condition, as well as
operator technique.
3. Based upon the IQCP performed for ACT-LR, manufacturer’s package insert was found
acceptable to follow for QC performance.
¢ Daily QC of the instrument: Electronic Quality Control provides a two-level check of the
instrument and is required once every 8 hours of instrument operation.
* QC of Hemochron Test Cuvettes: Each lot of cuvettes should be validated for
performance at two levels of Liquid Quality Control (Level 1 and Level 2)
e When a new shipment is received.
®  Once per 30 days, thereafter.
4. Quality Control results (electronic and liquid), the manufacturer lot numbers, and
expiration dates of reagents are automatically stored in the instrument database and
transmitted to a data management system.

16. Connect meter to data cable and press Print/Scan button, then select #6 —
“Transferring Data” will appear on display. Results are then downloaded to a
data management system and sent to patient’s EMR.

Note: If instrument is connected to data cable during testing, once cuvette is
removed data transfer will automatically occur.

RECALLING PATIENT/QC RESULTS from instrument:

Press Database button, then select 4-Display QC or 5-Display Pat. Follow prompts displayed on
the screen, to view detailed information about the results.

REPORTING RESULTS:

ACT-LR results should be reported to the attending nurse and/or physician. Hemochron
Signature Elite connects to a data port for transmission of patient test result to the hospital
information system. Patient ACT test results which include the ACT result (in seconds), date,
time, instrument serial#, reference range and name/ID of instrument operator, are then recorded
in the patient’s electronic medical record. These results can be found under Laboratory Testing.

REFERENCE RANGE
The Low Range Activated Clotting Time (ACT-LR) for normal patients is 122-170
seconds. The presence of heparin prolongs the clotting time.

REPORTABLE RANGE
The Low Range Activated Clotting Time (ACT-LR) reportable range is
100-400 seconds.

ABNORMAL RESULTS

ACT+ test results >400 seconds will be reported as >400 seconds in the patients’ medical
record. ACT+ results <100 seconds will be reported as <100 seconds in the patients’
medical record.

Note: Values outside the manufacturer range will display as follows: “Out of Range-HI”
if the value is >400 sec. and “Out of Range-Lo” if the value is <65 sec. These tests
should be repeated due to potential error in testing.

THERAPEUTIC RANGES

Consensus Statement Guidelines for ACT therapeutic ranges are followed by clinicians
dependent upon the patients clinical presentation during the procedure. Variation among
patient and procedure determines what ACT value is therapeutic, regardless of said
guidelines. As new medications are introduced guidelines are updated to include them.
See references below.

BATTERY USAGE
1. Plug the AC/DC Power Module into an electrical outlet and connect the AC/DC Power
cord to the power connector on side of the instrument. The charge indicator on the
instrument keypad will illuminate. Allow the battery to fully charge for at least 8 hours
prior to use. The AC/DC Power Module can remain connected all the time but may be
unplugged during testing. )
2. CHARGE BATTERY warning is displayed when the remaining battery power is

POINT OF CARE TESTING
BATON ROUGE, LA 70808

insufficient to ensure test completion.
3. BATTERY FAULT is displayed when the battery is completely discharged and cannot
be used to run additional tests.

4. A battery charge LED on the front panel is illuminated whenever the battery is being
charged.

CLEANING/DISINFECTION
Wear Gloves when cleaning/disinfecting instrument.
® The instrument is to be cleaned between each individual patient and when visibly
contaminated with blood.
® Inspect and clean the cuvette opening with water-moistened cotton swabs as needed.
*  Use hospital approved disinfection material or 10% bleach to wipe the instrument, taking
care not to get any liquid in the electronic openings
* Do Not Use solvents or strong cleaning solutions

TROUBLESHOOTING DISPLAY ERROR MESSAGES:

If an Error message appears on the instrument display during instrument self-check or test
performance, the message must be cleared before patient testing can resume. Notify the POCT
Department in the 1ab765-3479 or 765-6345, for assistance or refer to the “Troubleshooting”
section of the Operator’s Manual. IL Technical Support 1-800-579-2255 may also be contacted.

CALIBRATION:

The Signature Elite instrument is calibrated by the manufacturer. It is also self-calibrating, as all
instrument functions are continuously monitored and verified by the instrument software when a
test is performed. The instrument does not require additional calibration by the user.

LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE AND INTERFERING SUBSTANCES:

The accuracy and precision of the Hemochron Signature ACT-LR test results are dependent
upon the quality of the blood specimen and test system. Factors such as improper specimen
collection technique, transfer of blood to the cuvette, specimen contamination, improper cuvette
temperature, inadequate sample volume, will adversely affect the test results.

Samples from patients treated with aprotinin, a protease inhibitor, should not be used for ACT-
LR testing. Aprotinin interferes with the Celite activator causing an artificial prolongation of
ACT-LR result.

Samples with a hematocrit less than 20% or greater than 55% are not recommended due to an
optical density outside the level of detection of the instrument

The ACT may be affected by hemolysis of the sample, clotted or partially clotted blood,
unsuspected anticoagulation and Lupus anticoagulant.

Test results exhibiting inconsistency with the patient’s clinical status should be repeated or
supplemented with additional test procedures.
