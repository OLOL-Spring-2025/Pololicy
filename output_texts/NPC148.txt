Title: 
Ordering a Wearable Cardioverter-
Defibrillator/ Care of the Patient with a 
Wearable Cardioverter-Defibrillator 
Policy Reference #: NPC148 
Supersedes #:  
Date of Origination: September 16, 2014 Last Date Reviewed:  September 26, 
2024 
Last Date Revised: September 7, 2022 
 
PURPOSE:   
This policy outlines the process of care for the patient prescribed a wearable cardioverter-
defibrillator (WCD), which is used as a treatment option for patients evaluated for risk of sudden 
cardiac arrest (SCA).  
 
DEFINITIONS: 
As a cardioverter, the WCD uses low-energy electrical shocks to return a heart, exhibiting 
ventricular tachycardia (abnormally rapid heart rhythm), to a normal rhythm.  As a defibrillator, 
it uses high-energy shocks to a heart, in a state of ventricular fibrillation, to return it to a normal 
rhythm.  The WCD comprises wearable and nonwearable parts.  The wearable parts are the 
monitor, battery pack, alarm module, electrode belt, vest, and holster. The vest, worn under 
clothing, detects arrhythmias and delivers treatment shocks when detecting life-threatening 
arrhythmias, such as Ventricular Tachycardia. The non-wearable parts are the battery charger, 
modem, modem cable, computer cable, a secure internet website that maintains patient 
information, and a diagnostic tester.  The monitor is worn around the waist or from a shoulder 
strap and continuously monitors the patient’s heart. 
 
POLICY: 
It is the policy of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center that the WCD device is 
provided, per physician order , for the individual patient as deemed necessary to avoid  risk of 
sudden cardiac death ( post cardiac arrest, CABG or stent placement, cardiomyopathies, and 
CHF) 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
1. Typical criteria for use is the patient who has indications for an ICD implant, but who’s 
condition delays or prohibits immediate implantation pending evaluation. 
 
Once the need has been established a medical management consult order must be secured with 
the following information:  reason for the consult (WCD), length of service (usually in months), 
and the physicians NPI number.  The medical management team will then contact the WCD 
company and provide them with the correct documentation.

1. The WCD is ordered for the individual patient as per physician’s orders and applied 
according to manufacturer instructions.  The vest is applied to the patient with the 
attachment of the battery after vest is in place by the clinical representative. (See 
attached). Patient education and agreement for use of the WCD is then signed and a 
copy left in the chart. 
 
2. Once obtained, the WCD is always worn by the patient, except during a brief shower 
or bath.  
  
The patient and family must be informed and demonstrate understanding of the 
method of applying the vest, cleaning the vest, communicating information regarding 
arrhythmias while the vest is worn, and all alarms.  The WCD clinician will ascertain 
understanding post teaching, and the patient will sign an acknowledgement of 
education and understanding received. 
 
 
3. How to proceed should a patient with a WCD detect a life-threatening arrhythmia: 
 
Before delivering a shock, the WCD will test to see if patient is alert/conscious by 
providing the patient the opportunity to PRESS AND HOLD the response buttons to 
prevent a shock. ONLY THE PATIENT is to press. The patient may feel a vibration, 
along with alerts and voice prompts, to avoid a shock.  
 
The time to treatment will vary between 25-60 seconds, depending on the type and 
rate of the arrhythmia, and whether the patient has responded to the prompts.  
 
The vest will warn bystanders with both a siren alert and a voice command stating, 
“Electrical shock possible, do not touch patient” or “Bystander do not interfere” 
before a shock is delivered. 
 
To avoid incidental shock, emergency personnel should not touch the patient while a 
shock is being delivered.  
 
The WCD will release a Blue Gel, prior to shock treatment, to improve conduction 
and mitigate burning. The gel should remain on the patient if an additional shock is 
required.  
 
Should the patient: 
a) Not have a successful arrhythmia conversion, emergency personnel may start 
ACLS. Disconnect the monitor from the electrode belt, wash off the gel with 
water, apply factory cardioversion/defibrillation pads and resume CPR. You do 
not need to remove the vest. 
 
b) Have a successful cardioversion/defibrillation of his initial rhythm, leave vest on, 
and have patient seen by his physician.

4. Alarm types and responses indicated: 
 
Silent or Gong Alarm (Single 
tone) 
Siren Alarm (Two Tone) Siren Alarm (Two Tone) 
(device testing for patient 
consciousness) 
Voice:   
• None device silent 
• “Contact physician” 
• “Treatment has been given, call 
your doctor” 
Voice: 
• “If patient is not 
responsive, call for help, 
perform CPR” 
• “Device disabled, call 
Code 0” 
Voice: 
• “Press response button to 
delay treatment” 
• “Electrical shock possible 
– DO NOT TOUCH 
PATIENT” 
• “Bystanders do not 
interfere” 
Status: 
• Device is monitoring the patient 
• Device may be alerting the 
patient to follow instructions on 
the screen 
Status: 
• Device cannot detect 
EKG or the device has 
delivered the maximum 
number of treatments 
Status: 
• Device has detected a 
ventricular arrhythmia 
• Device is preparing to 
treat the patient 
• Shock likely 
• Stop CPR 
• Only the patient should 
press the response buttons 
(patient consciousness 
test) 
• Do not touch patient 
• Allow device to treat the 
patient 
Shen siren alarm stops or “if 
patient is not responsive, call for 
help, perform CPR” is broadcasted 
Note:  During CPR battery must be disconnected to avoid any chance of unintentional shock to patient or 
healthcare provider. 
Proceed to monitor mode instructions below 
Monitor Mode Instructions: 
• Proceed with standard evaluation and treatment measures. 
• CPR can be performed if the device is not broadcasting “press the response buttons”, 
“electrical shock possible, do not touch patient”, or “bystanders do not interfere”. 
• If external defibrillation is available, a decision can be made to remove the WCD and 
monitor/treat the patient with the external equipment. 
• To remove the WCD, first pull out the battery, then remove the garment from the 
patient.

Page 6 of 6 
  
Wearable AED (K0606) are covered as an alternative to implanted defibrillators when criteria’s specified 
in the automated External Defibrillator Local Coverage Determination (LCD) are met. Wearable AEDs are 
covered for patients if they meet one of the following criteria: 
 
 
1. A documented episode of ventricular fibrillation or a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, lasting 
30 seconds or longer.  These dysrhythmias may be either spontaneous or induced during an 
electrophysiology (EP) study, but may not be due to a transient or reversible cause , and not occur 
during the first 48 hours of an acute myocardial infarction (ICD-9 427.1, 427.42, 427.5)    
 
2. Familial or inherited conditions with a high risk of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia, 
such as long QT syndrome (ICD-9 426.82) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ICD-9 425.1); or 
 
 
3. Either documented prior to myocardial infarction (ICD-9 410.0, 410.92, 412) or dilated 
cardiomyopathy (ICD-9 425.0-, 425.9) and a measured left ventricular ejection fraction less than 
or equal to 0.35; or 
 
4. A previously implanted defibrillator now requires explanation (ICD-9 996.04, 996.61)
