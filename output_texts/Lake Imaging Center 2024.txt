Anything that makes the department unique from a life safety standpoint.  
• Identify any types of equipment that would need to be turned of 
▪ MRI – Each MRI technologist will be responsible for evacuating the patient in their MRI 
suite.  Once the technologist has evacuated the patient the door to each suite will be closed 
and locked as long as the fire is not in the MRI suite.  If the fire is in the MRI suite the 
magnet will be quenched by a technologist.  This is accomplished by depressing the red 
stop button behind the control panel.  The magnet will be quenched to allow emergency 
personnel to safely enter the room with their equipment.
