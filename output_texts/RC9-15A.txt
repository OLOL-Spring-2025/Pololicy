POLICY: 
Stock will always be rotated so that the older stock is utilized first.  All test cards will be 
stored as recommended by the manufacturer.  The test cards are properly labeled with 
contents, storage requirements, and expiration date. Also, there is a barcode on the test 
card to identify the Card Type, “Use By” date, serial and lot number.  The epoc Reader 
will read the barcode and reject any Test Card past the “Use By” date. The system is 
designed to prevent the utilization of any expired cartridge.  Once received, the Test 
Cards will be stored at room temperature (between 15 degrees and 30 degrees). These 
Test Cards have an indicator which changes if the temperature was not maintained during 
shipping.  This indicator will be verified when received.  If the indicator has changed to a 
red color either during shipping or while stored, then the test cards will be will not be 
used.  Epocal Inc. will be contacted to arrange for exchange of Test Cards. All 
heparinized syringes are used within the expiration date and are stored per the 
manufacturer instruction or will be discarded.
