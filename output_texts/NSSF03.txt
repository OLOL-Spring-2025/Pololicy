Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Plan 
 
The purpose of this policy is to identify hazards and critical control points in food preparation, 
establish critical limits for preventive measures, develop and implement procedures for 
monitoring critical control points and establish methods for corrective action to be taken when 
monitoring shows that a critical limit has been exceeded. 
 
 The Nutritional Services Department adheres to the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point 
(HACCP) process designed to prevent the occurrence of potential food safety problems. The 
HACCP process works in conjunction with Nutritional Services policy & procedures for 
employee dress code and infection control. In addition, the HACCP process serves as one of the 
ongoing monitors for the Process Improvement Plan as it relates to patient care.  
 
Procedure: 
 
1. Food is purchased through foodservice distribution companies that comply with good 
manufacturing practices. The director should make periodic visits to inspect the facilities 
of the Prime Vendor. 
 
2. Each morning the AM supervisor records the temperatures of all the refrigerators, 
freezers, reach-in cooler, dish machine, and pot machine with temperature logs provided.  
Any units not within the acceptable range will be shut down and food transferred to 
holding area of <40 degrees.  If internal temperature of food is > 45 degrees it shall be 
discarded.   
 
3. Upon receipt of refrigerated and frozen foods the production manager or storeroom clerk 
will check the temperatures of the food and visually inspect the packaging to insure 
quality. 
i) If the recorded temperatures do not adhere to department standards (frozen foods: 
0F- 20F; refrigerated foods: < 40F), the delivery of that pallet is rejected. 
   2 
 
 
 
4. Upon the completion of the cooking process of all food items, the cooks check the 
internal temperature of all foods.  If the internal temperature (of specific food type; i.e. 
chicken, beef, etc.) does not adhere to the department standard, the food is to be cooked 
or chilled until the desired temperature is obtained. 
 
5. When the food is placed on the steam table, the supervisor and/or cook(s) at each meal is 
to record all food temperatures. If hot foods (>140º) and cold foods (<40º) do not meet 
department standards respectively, the food is to be returned to the production cooks. The 
production cooks, in turn, continues cooking the hot food item(s) until the desired 
internal temperature is reached. Cold items are to be chilled in the freezer until the 
desired temperature is achieved. 
 
6. A test tray from each meal period will be used by the Patient Service’s Manager to verify 
temperature appropriateness on a weekly basis.  Plate temperatures should be 170 
degrees; pellet base temperatures should be 225 degrees.   
 
7.        Leftover foods must be chilled down to an internal temperature of 70 degrees within 2 
hours and then down to 40 degrees in an additional 4 hours (a total of 6 hours of cooling is 
allowed) Procedure must be documented on heating and cooling log.

HACCP Refrigerator Temperature Log -- One Form per Month 
Refrigerator Location:    
 Use a separate temperature Log Sheet for each walk-in/reach-in refrigeration location. 
 Maintain refrigerator temperature at 40F (4C) or below during stable times. 
 Check and record temperature ocen a day (i.e. at opening of the operation)  
 Complete corrective action column if temperatures are not in proper ranges.  
Check either an accurate internal probe (hanging or standing refrigerator thermometer) or Built -in 
equipment thermometer

HACCP COOLING AND REHEATING CHART  
TIME/TEMPERATURE LOG FOR POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOODS 
Critical Control Points: 
 --   Food is cooled quickly and safely from 140ºF (60ºC) to 70oF (21oC) within 2 hours and then to 40oF (4oC) or below within an additional 4 hours (total 
cooling time 6 hours). 
 --   Food that is cooked, cooled and reheated for hot holding is reheated rapidly (within 2 hours) to 165 oF (74oC) for 15 seconds.  
SEE REVERSE SIDE OF THIS FORM FOR: 
 --   Corrective action steps if time/temperature requirement for cooling and reheating have not been met.  
 --   Temperature recording procedure where operation is closed before cooling period has been completed.
