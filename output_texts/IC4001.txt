PURPOSE:  
The primary purpose of the patient and employee surveillance phase of the Infection Prevention 
and C ontrol program is the early detection of both community and healthcare-associated 
infections (HAI) and the establishment of control measures as formulated by the Infection 
Prevention and Control Department.  Surveillance focuses on the prevention and/or intervention 
of infections to mitigate the risk of future occurrences. 
Healthcare-associated infection (HAI) data is collected for the following purposes: 
1. To monitor the effects of intervention and strategies on infection rates. 
2. To provide feedback to physicians, nurses, and support staff about the healthcare-
associated infection risk of their patients. 
Providing healthcare workers with valid measures of the risk of infection in their patients often 
allows them to take action to reduce those risks and decrease infection rates. 
 
 
METHOD: 
HAI surveillance data is collected prospectively and retrospectively by the Infection Prevention 
and Control Department.  The identification of infection in patients is based on review of 
laboratory and clinical sources of information about potentially infected patients.  The CDC 
definitions for classification of healthcare-associated infections are used to identify healthcare-
associated infections.  The following sources of information are considered for case -finding to 
identify patients with possible HAIs: 
1. Microbiology Culture Reports/Other Lab Results - Microbiology culture reports and 
other lab test results provide the most useful information.  The Infection Preventionists 
review positive culture reports.   Included in the reports are the type of specimen, the 
organism isolated, and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern.  Attention is given to 
emerging pathogens and any significant isolates. 
2. Verbal and other reports by hospital personnel - Hospital personnel  such as Charge 
Nurses, Clinical Nurse Specialists, Pharm D., ICU nurses, etc.  are helpful in identifying 
patients with infections.

Surveillance will include the following indicators: 
1. Surgical Site Infections (SSI) - Surgical procedures complicated by a wound infection 
during hospitalization or post -discharge are monitored. Selected individual procedures 
will be monitored for procedure-specific infection rates. 
a. In accordance with CMS IPPS Rule, all SSIs that occur after colon surgery  
(COLO) and abdominal hysterectomy  (HYST) will be reported to CMS 
through the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). 
b. The reporting of SSIs related to the following surgeries are done voluntarily: 
CARD, CBGB, CBGC, CRAN, FUSN (for Children’s Hospital location 
only), HPRO, KPRO, NECK, REC, THOR, and VSHN (for Children’s 
Hospital location only) 
2. Central Line -Associated Bloodstream Infection  (CLABSI) – Housewide surveillance – 
Inpatients will be mon itored for CLABSIs and primary bloodstream infections.  Unit 
specific infection rates  will be used as a quality indicator.  Because oncology is a 
specialty care unit, it will have  a CLABSI rate for both permanent central lines and 
temporary central lines. 
a.  In accordance with CMS IPPS Rule, all inpatient CLABSIs will be reported 
to CMS through the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).   
3. Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) – Housewide surveillance – 
Inpatients will be monitored for CAUTIs.  Unit specific infection rates are used as a 
quality indicator. 
a. In accordance with CMS IPPS Rule, all inpatient CAUTIs will be reported to 
CMS through the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). 
4. Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) – Housewide surveillance is performed on all inpatient 
units for healthcare facility -onset C. diff. infections.  Beginning January 1, 2013, 
mandatory NHSN reporting of all C. diff lab ID events was implemented. 
5. Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms (MDRO) – Housewide surveillance is performed on all 
inpatient units for healthcare-associated MDROs. Beginning January 1, 2013, mandatory 
NHSN reporting of all MRSA bacteremia lab ID events was implemented.   Voluntary 
reporting of CRE lab ID events implemented in 2018. 
6. Positive microbiology cultures will be monitored.  Problem -oriented surveillance will be 
conducted when a problem is noted that exceeds the expected number of infections . 
Previously established baseline data will be used for comparison. 
7. Physicians will notify Infection Control of  patients that develop surgical site infections 
(via letter): 
a. After patient care procedures 
b. During r eadmission or return to the Emergency Department due to the 
development of infection 
8. Problem-oriented response surveillance will be conducted when a problem is noted by the 
case-finding methods, which exceed the expected number of infections (the previously 
established hospital-wide surveillance baseline data will be used for comparison). 
 
The rationales for selecting this specific surveillance approach are: 
a. to identify infections that are high volume,  3 
b. to identify surgical cases that have frequent infectious complications or high potential 
for adverse patient outcomes, 
c. to identify device-associated infections, 
d. to identify infections deemed reportable by regulatory agencies. 
 
These indicators will be used to monitor performance and to assist in the development of 
performance-focused standards and for healthcare workers education.   Data is compared to the 
CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) benchmarking system.
