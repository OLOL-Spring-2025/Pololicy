POLICY NUMBER: 
COR - 302 
 
SCOPE:  
  Applies to Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOLRMC) and its wholly owned 
Sponsored Organizations (collectively referred to herein as “Entity”) that use, disclose, create, 
receive, maintain or transmit Protected Health Information, as defined below.    
PURPOSE:   
  To provide guidance for the proper acceptance and processing of a patient’s right to opt out of 
an Entity Directory. 
POLICY:   
  Patient’s Protected Health Information may be used to maintain a directory of patients who are 
admitted to an Entity (the “Entity Directory”) except when an objection is expressed by the 
patient or the patient’s personal representative. 
DEFINITIONS: 
  “Covered Entity” means a health plan, health care clearinghouse, or a health care provider who 
transmits any health information in connection with a transaction covered by HIPAA, such as 
electronic claims submission. 
  “Entity” means OLOLRMC and its wholly owned sponsored organizations 
  “Entity Directory” means the list of patients who are admitted to any Entity. 
  “Notice of Privacy Practices or NPP” means a Covered Entity’s notice required by regulations 
implementing HIPAA’s privacy recommendations that describe the Covered Entity’s uses and 
disclosures of a patient’s Protected Health Information, the Covered Entity’s legal duties 
regarding a patient’s Protected Health Information, an individual’s rights regarding his or her 
Protected Health Information and the types of uses and disclosures that require an individual’s 
authorization. 
  “Protected Health Information or PHI” means all information, including demographic data,  
2 
 
that relates to an individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, the 
provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision 
of health care to an individual, and that identifies an individual or for which there is a reasonable 
basis to believe it can be used to identify an individual.  Individually identifiable health 
information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security 
Number).  Individually identifiable health information in employment records held by an Entity 
in its role as an employer is not PHI (e.g., employment-related testing and employer health 
assessments.) 
“Sponsored Organization” means a legal entity either wholly-owned by OLORMC or a 
subsidiary entity of an entity wholly-owned by OLOLRMC that is also a Covered Entity. 
PROCEDURE: 
Information Included in Entity Directory 
   The following information may be used to maintain the Facility Directory: 
A. Patient’s name; 
B. Patient’s location; 
C. Patient’s condition in general terms (e.g., good, fair, poor, critical or deceased); and 
D. Patient’s religious affiliation.   
Facility Directory Access 
   The above information may be disclosed to community clergy.  Other persons who ask for the 
patient by name may be told the patient’s location and condition only. 
Right to Opt-Out of Directory 
   Each patient or the patient’s personal representative shall be notified by means of the Notice of 
Privacy Practices of his/her right to opt out of being listed in the Entity Directory.  A patient or 
the patient’s personal representative may request to opt out of the Facility Directory by 
completing a “Directory Disclosure – Status Change Request” (see Attachment A).  All opt out 
requests shall be forwarded to the Patient Access/Admitting Supervisor or his/her designee to 
ensure patient information is made confidential within the registration system.  A patient who 
has elected to opt out of the facility directory may request to opt back in at any time by 
completing the attached form. 
Patient Inability to Opt Out 
 If the opportunity to object to being included in the Entity Directory cannot be provided (e.g., 
patient is incapacitated or in an emergency treatment circumstance), the patient may be included 
in the Entity Directory unless the applicable medical provider determines, in his/her professional 
judgment, that the patient should not be listed in the Entity Directory.  As soon as reasonably 
practicable, the patient shall be informed and provided the opportunity to object (i.e., when the 
patient is able to receive the Notice of Privacy Practices).  
Emergency Circumstances.  
 If the patient is incapacitated and cannot object to the release of information, the Entity may use or  
3 
 
disclose all of the protected health information for the facilities directory, if the disclosure is: 
1. Consistent with a prior expressed preference of the individual, if any, that is known 
2. In the individual’s best interest as determined by the Entity 
 
 The Entity must inform and provide an opportunity to object to uses or disclosures for directory purposes 
when it becomes practicable to do so.
