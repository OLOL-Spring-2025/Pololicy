PURPOSE: 
To provide a policy whereby hazardous waste and materials can be stored in a safe manner to prevent injury to patients or 
personnel. 
POLICY: 
All hazardous materials are received into the department by appropriate personnel and stored in a supply closet for 
chemicals only. They are properly labeled with a description of the hazard they represent. Since storage space may be 
limited, acid and alkali products may be stored together, but only if they are suitably separated. 
Par levels have been established for these hazardous chemicals, and purchases are made based upon these levels. 
Storage areas are kept under lock and key until they are needed. 
The storage areas for hazardous chemicals are cleaned and organized weekly. 
Hazardous waste storage and processing areas will be free of clutter and effectively separated from patient care, food 
preparation and serving areas.
