Policy: 
 
Patient admission into the Outpatient Pulmonary Rehabilitation program requires physician referral with a 
written order. Conditions appropriate for Pulmonary Rehabilitation include: 
 
CONDITIONS APPROPRIATE FOR PULMONARY REHABILITATION 
 
Obstructive Disease 
 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 
  -Chronic Bronchitis 
  -Emphysema 
 Asthma and Asthmatic Bronchitis 
 Bronchiectasis 
 Cystic Fibrosis 
 Bronchiolitis obliterans 
 Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (a 1 AT) 
 
Restrictive Disease 
 Interstitial Diseases 
  -Interstitial Fibrosis, including rheumatoid lung and other disorders secondary to   
   collagen-vascular disease 
  -Occupational or environmental lung disease 
 Chest Wall Diseases 
  -Kyphoscoliosis 
  -Spondylitis 
 Neuromuscular Diseases 
  -Parkinson's Disease 
  -Postpolio syndrome 
  -Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
  -Diaphragm dysfunction 
  -Multiple sclerosis 
   
 
 
 Other Conditions 
 Lung Cancer 
 Primary pulmonary hypertension 
 Post-thoracic surgery 
 Before and after lung transplantation/ lung resection (Pneumoplasty) 
 Ventilator dependency 
 Pediatric patients with pulmonary disease 
 Morbid Obesity 
 Sleep Apnea 
 
POSSIBLE CONTRAINDICATIONS TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION 
 
Ischemic cardiac disease 
Congestive heart failure 
Acute cor pulmonale 
Severe pulmonary hypertension 
Significant hepatic dysfunction 
Metastatic cancer 
Disabling stroke 
Active substance abuse 
Severe cognitive deficit 
Severe psychiatric disorder 
 
PATIENT SELECTION 
 
Any patient with impairment because of lung disease, and who is motivated, should qualify as a candidate 
for Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR). 
 
Patient Selection Criteria for Pulmonary Rehabilitation 
 
 Impaired quality of life 
 Reduction in physical activity 
 Decreased occupational performance 
 Dependence in activities of daily living 
 Noncompliance with medication regime (e.g., oxygen, aerosolized medications) 
 Psychosocial problems 
 Increased use of medical resources (e.g., hospitalizations, urgent care/emergency room visits, 
                      Physician visits) 
 Comorbidity 
 Pulmonary function abnormalities 
 Arterial oxygenation 
 Smoking history 
 Motivation for rehabilitation, including time commitment and active program participation 
 Transportation needs 
 Financial resources 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Possible Indications For Pulmonary Function Test 
 
A recent pulmonary function test (PFT) will be requested from the referring physician for each patient upon 
admission into the Pulmonary Rehabilitation program. Indications for a PFT include: 
 
 Identify high risk smoker 
 Early detection of lung disease 
 Follow course of lung disease 
 Measure therapy effectiveness 
 Determine cause of dyspnea 
 Determine degree of impairment 
 
Possible Tests During Initial Evaluation of a Pulmonary Rehab Candidate 
 
 -Spirometry pre/post bronchodilator 
 -Lung volumes 
 -Diffusing capacity 
 -Resting arterial blood gas 
 -Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry 
 -Chest radiograph 
 -Resting electrocardiogram 
 -Complete blood count 
 -Exercise test with cutaneous oximetry and/or arterial blood gas (simple or modified test such as 6 or 
   12 minutes walk, master's step, calibrated cycle ergometer, or motorized treadmill) 
 -Complete blood count 
 -Basic blood chemistry panel
