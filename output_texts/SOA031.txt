PURPOSE:  
To provide a mechanism to review cases that conflict and to establish a process for resolution. 
 
DEFINITIONS:  
  
 Emergent = 0-2 hours Life, limb or organ threatening conditions requiring 
immediate attention. Take precedence over any 
other case performed.  In the first available 
operating room. Will bump pre-scheduled cases 
during regular hours.  
 
 Urgent = > 2 hours to 24 hours Life, limb or organ threatening conditions requiring 
surgery within a time period greater than 2 hrs. but 
within 24 hours.   
 
During evenings, nights and weekends, these emergencies and urgent cases may require the on call  
team to be readily available on site during off hours.  
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
NOTE: If a case must be bumped, the Surgeon with the Urgent/Emergent Case must communicate 
to the Surgeon whose case will be bumped. 
 
A. If a surgeon needs to interrupt the OR schedule with an emergency case, the algorithm 
will be as follows: 
1. Bumps self 
2. Empty OR with available staff 
3. First available OR 
B.  The decision of which case to bump will be the responsibility of the anesthesiologist in 
collaboration with OR Management. 
C.  If necessary, the Chief of Surgery will make the final call on immediate conflicts. 
D.  Elective or non-urgent cases are strongly discouraged from weekends and after hours. 
E.   Retrospective reviews will be conducted of any emergency surgery that is questioned as 
potentially inappropriate by the facilityâ€™s Peri-Operative Governance committee or  2 
medical staff councils.
