PRINCIPLE 
 
Prior to each autopsy, the descendant’s identity is confirmed using two identifiers. 
 
 
PROCEDURE 
 
Prior to beginning the autopsy, a “time out” is performed. During this procedure the patient is 
identified using a toe tag and a bracelet, each with at least two patient identifiers on them (Name, 
MRN, DOB) 
 
If bracelet and toe tag are not found on the patient, do not perform the autopsy.  Contact Patient 
Care Services or the floor to identify and properly apply patient identification.   
 
This identification check is documented in the autopsy report.
