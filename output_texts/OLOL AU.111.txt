Louisiana law RS 40ยง1271.2. Mandatory identification of infected corpses 
 
Each hospital, nursing home, and coroner which requests a funeral director or embalmer to 
transport a corpse shall notify any such funeral director, embalmer, or a representative thereof 
whenever there is actual knowledge that the corpse is infected with a contagious disease. The 
hospital, nursing home, or coroner shall inform the funeral director, embalmer, or representative 
thereof that the corpse is infected with a contagious disease during the initial telephone 
communication requesting that the corpse be transported. Further notification shall include a 
clearly visible, external tag that is readily discernible from other identification markers and a 
written statement that clearly indicates the name of the contagious disease or causative agent 
infecting or infesting said corpse. Such notification shall be made in a manner that protects the 
confidentiality of the deceased and the funeral director or embalmer handling the corpse.
