PURPOSE: 
Provide for the collection of an appropriate blood volume for various ordered laboratory tests performed on 
pediatric patients in order to avoid phlebotomy- induced anemia 
 
Addresses: 
Supervisors 
Venipuncture Charge Techs  
Venipuncture Phlebotomists 
 
PROCEDURE: 
A. Minimal Sample volumes for ordered lab tests 
• Request minimum test sample volumes and other special sample handling requirements with the 
respective laboratory section before going to the patient’s room 
• Prior to entering the patient’s room ask the patient’s nurse for current patient status and possible 
laboratory order changes 
• Properly identify the patient before performing the blood collection procedure (refer to the Patient 
Identification Procedure) 
• Care and discretion are necessary when performing pediatric blood collections, determine before 
beginning the procedure: 
1.   Can a dermal (capillary) puncture collection provide the necessary sample volume or should a   
  venipuncture be performed. 
2.   Examine the child to determine if you have the experience necessary to draw the child 
• Neonates (newborns :) Neonates are to have blood drawn by dermal puncture using the heel as the 
collection site unless the required test blood volume is greater than can be collected using this technique 
• Infants (non-walking): Infants up to approximately one year of age and are not walking are to have blood 
drawn by dermal puncture using the heel as the collection site unless the required blood volume is 
greater than can be collected using this technique 
• Infants (walking):Walking infants are to have blood drawn by dermal punctures using the 3rd or 4th finger 
as the collection site unless the required blood volume is greater than can be collected using this 
technique 
• An infant of any age will need to be drawn using the venipuncture technique if the required test volume 
exceeds the volume that can be collected using the dermal puncture technique 
B. Draw Attempts: 
• One Venous Draw attempt: No more than one attempt to obtain a venous phlebotomy sample should be 
made on the same child OUR LADY OF THE LAKE RMC

• A single attempt to collect the sample using dermal puncture may be made following failure of the 
venous phlebotomy attempt if sufficient blood volume can be obtained using this technique 
• Two Dermal Puncture attempts: No more than two consecutive attempts to obtain a dermal puncture 
sample should be made on the same child. 
• The patient’s nurse or physician needs to be notified of each collection failure in order to make the best 
decision in regard to the patient’s care 
• The patient’s nurse or physician may choose to draw the patient’s blood 
C. Special Collections 
• Collection of Blood Bank Specimens 
1.   Infants less than 4 months old 
o Collect a 2ml purple top tube from the child 
2.   Infants 4 months or older 
o Collect a 2ml purple top tube from the child 
o A sample from the mother is not required 
o The ideal sample is a fully filled 9ml purple top tube 
• Collection of Blood Culture Specimens 
1.   For pediatric patients weighing less than 37 Kg (81.5 pounds), a weight-based blood volume is  
  collected.  Refer to the table below for the required volume of blood per kilogram (pound) of body  
  weight. 
2.   Anaerobic bottles are drawn on pediatric patients when requested by the physician. 
3.   Sample collection volumes may vary due to the patient’s condition and difficulty encountered in  
  performing the venipuncture.  Recommended collection volumes are as noted: 
Recommended Pediatric Weight-Based Blood Culture Volumes

Volume of blood 
 
If 1 set is ordered 
Recommended Volume of blood per culture 
 
 
If 2 sets of cultures are ordered
