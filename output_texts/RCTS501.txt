POLICY: The following is a description of the Rehabilitation Center’s Occupational Therapy philosophy: 
Occupational Therapy is a holistic approach used to ensure that a patient reaches his/her maximum functional 
level after a disability occurs.  When a person suffers a disability, the Occupational Therapist evaluates its affects 
cognitively, perceptually, emotionally, and physically.  Then, in an effort to progress the patient back to his/her 
functional level prior to injury/illness, exercise, therapeutic activities, ADL retraining, splinting, and physical 
modalities are used.  Adaptive equipment is issued, if necessary, to increase independence and ensure safety. 
Home evaluations are also available to those patients as deemed necessary, based on architectural barriers or 
family/patient concerns that may hinder a patient’s independence or safety in the actual home environment.  
Facilities within the rehab center are also used for patients to perform/practice home-simulated tasks such as a 
kitchen for meal preparation, a tub for bathing and a washer/dryer for washing clothes. 
It is the Occupational Therapist’s intent to provide high quality care to meet the individual needs of each patient 
and increase the quality of life through independent living.  The scope of service extends to patient/family and 
staff with emphasis on coordinating efforts with team members to meet team and patient goals.
