PURPOSE: 
To ensure the safety of patients, visitors, and team members in the event of a fire or to the conditions 
that indicate the presence of a fire. To prepare staff to appropriately respond to the danger fires present 
by addressing aspects of fire prevention, preparedness, control, and education.  To delineate authority, 
responsibilities, and procedures to follow in the event of a fire. 
 
POLICY: 
In the event of a fire, all staff will follow Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center’s (OLOL) 
written Code RED Safety and Response Plan along with location specific plans to guide prevention, 
preparation, and proper response to fires. Each location’s Code RED Safety and Response Plan will be 
used in conjunction with the Emergency Operations Plan (ECEP001). 
 
Contractors, students, licensed practitioners, and volunteers are to follow the instruction of unit manager 
or designee. 
 
The OLOL Code RED Safety and Response Plan will also be used for fire drills.  Fire drills will 
evaluate fire safety equipment, fire safety building features, and staff response to fire. 
 
Each OLOL department will have their own Department Specific Code RED Safety and Response Plan. 
 
 
The Code RED Safety and Response Plan is maintained and evaluated annually by the Safety Officer and 
Plant Services Director or designee in conjunction with the Environment of Care Committee. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
 
FIRE PREVENTION 
 
One of the most important ways we can help prevent fires is through surveillance. Routine inspections 
can uncover both potential fire hazards and safety hazards. Through the use of routine surveillance, 
anyone can discover fire hazards before a fire actually occurs.  Routine surveillance of various areas of 
the hospital includes: 
a. Departmental Safety Rounding 
b. EOC Rounding 
 
The person who uses a piece of equipment on an everyday basis is in the best position to discover 
something wrong with that piece of equipment. Area leaders ensure all staff are properly trained in the 
use of equipment.  Staff should know not only how to use the equipment, but also how to recognize and  ECEP007 
Page 2 of 15 
report equipment, which is not working properly, and how to know if the equipment poses a fire or 
safety hazard. Each supervisor must take steps to eliminate reported hazards promptly. 
 
A. Exit Ways – Do not permit obstruction of aisles, doorways, stairwells or allow their use as 
storage places. 
 
B. Fire Doors – The proper operation of fire doors is necessary to protect or isolate one section of 
the building from another, thus providing protection to other areas and persons within the 
building.  Keep all fire doors properly closed, except those equipped to close automatically.  Fire 
doors wedged or propped open are of no value in preventing the spread of fire. 
 
C. Electric Heaters and Toasters – (see ECSF013 Electrical Equipment) 
 
D. Smoking and Smoking Materials 
Our Lady of the Lake (OLOL) and all affiliates are SMOKE FREE.  Inform others about our 
SMOKE FREE policy.  Stop violators tactfully.  Know and understand the Hospital’s SMOKE 
FREE policy and make sure it is enforced in your area. (see OOEC006 Tobacco Free 
Environment) 
 
E. Electrical Hazards 
Check outlets, cords, and appliances for signs of wear and tear.   
 
F. Combustible Material Build-Up 
A build-up of rubbish, waste, used rags, etc., offers fire a place to grow. Good housekeeping 
habits, such as keeping work areas clean and free of trash, reduce the risk of fire.  This oversight 
includes improper storage of equipment, waste, etc.  
 
G. Flammable Liquids – (Such as acetone, alcohol, benzene, chafing fuels, and ether) limit the 
amount on hand to a minimum working supply.  These items should be labeled and properly 
stored and secured. 
 
FIRE CONTROL 
 
A. Building Design and Construction 
a. Fire and Smoke Compartments are identified by the red tag on the top of the door frame 
and/or on Life Safety Plans. 
 
1. Fire Compartments 
Fire compartments are well-defined spaces within the building which separate one area 
from another.  Fire compartments consist of fire-resistant walls, ceilings, floors, and doors 
with specifically timed fire ratings which inhibit the spread of fire for the stated period of 
time. These compartments also restrict the movement of smoke. 
 
2. Smoke Compartments  
Smoke compartments are areas within the building consisting of smoke barriers on all 
sides, including the top and bottom, which inhibit the passage of smoke to other areas. 
 
Fire Alarm Systems may include components such as audio-visual alarms, annunciation panels,  ECEP007 
Page 3 of 15 
smoke detectors, manual pull stations, and gaseous clean agents.  Manual pull stations are 
located throughout the facility, at the entrance to all stairwells, near hospital exits and along 
other travel routes. 
 
The system may be activated in the following ways: 
1. Smoke reaching a smoke detector. 
2. Heat contact with a sprinkler head. 
3. Manual activation of the pull station. 
4. A mechanical malfunction. 
5. A significant change in sprinkler system water pressure. 
 
When a smoke detector, manual pull station, or sprinkler head is activated, the alarm site is 
displayed on the fire alarm annunciator panel which is found in areas that are staffed 24-hours a 
day (and in other areas based on each location).  The display specifies the location and equipment 
which originated the alarm. At the same time, the Code RED audio and visual alarms will 
activate.   
 
The alarm light will remain illuminated until cleared and reset by Plant Services or designee.  
The alarm will only be silenced as directed by the proper authority. All alarms will be reset after 
the cause of the alarm is investigated and verified to be safe. 
 
Notification: 
1. Upon receiving the notification of the fire and location, the designated person will clearly 
announce three times: “Code RED, location”. 
2. The designated person will call the Administrator on Call (AOC) to notify them of the event.  
3. Once the fire incident has been resolved, the designated person will clearly announce three 
times: “All Clear Code RED, location”. 
 
 
FIRE SUPPRESSION 
 
A. Automatic fire suppression systems are in areas based on the need of that location.  These 
may include: 
1. Automatic water sprinkler system has sprinkler heads located throughout most of the 
facility.    
2. Gaseous Systems, such as those near Computer Servers 
3. Preaction Systems, such as those near Imaging equipment 
4. Dry Chemical Systems, such as those near kitchen equipment 
5. Foam Systems, such as those at Helicopter Landing Pads 
 
B. The fire pump status is displayed on the fire panel. 
 
C. Sprinkler control valves are always open.  If closed, a trouble alarm will be displayed on the 
fire alarm panel. 
 
 
D. Portable fire extinguishers are located throughout the facility.   
1. Know where the nearest fire extinguisher is located. In general, they will be near  ECEP007 
Page 4 of 15 
exits and along hallways. In office areas, they will be near work areas or near doors 
leading out to hallways.  
2. Portable extinguishers require human intervention to work. Staff should know how 
to handle a portable fire extinguisher. All are encouraged to become familiar with 
locating, supporting, and properly operating a fire extinguisher.  Fire extinguishers 
can be hard to handle, heavy, and a bit bulky.  To successfully employ a fire 
extinguisher, staff should be aware of the extinguisher’s physical characteristics. 
3. There are specific areas that require specific types of fire extinguishers.  These areas 
include:  
• MRI areas – Nonferrous (non-magnetic) 
• Kitchen areas – K type 
• Anesthetizing areas – CO2 
• Helipads – AB 
 
To understand how a fire extinguisher works, it will be helpful to understand some of the basic 
chemistry of fire.  The factors necessary to sustain a fire are: 
 
 
 
 
 
All these factors must be present in order to have a fire. If any of these 
three factors are removed, the fire will go out. Modern fire extinguishers 
work by either removing the heat or the oxygen. 
 
 
 
 
 
To help remember these steps, think of the four-step “P.A.S.S.” Procedure:  
P =  PULL 
Hold the extinguisher upright and pull the pin. This unlocks the operating lever so you can discharge 
the chemical. 
 ECEP007 
Page 5 of 15 
 
A =  AIM LOW 
Point the extinguisher nozzle at the base of the fire. 
 
S =  SQUEEZE 
Squeeze the lever to discharge the chemical. 
 
S =  SWEEP 
Sweep the nozzle from side to side.  Move slowly forward toward the fire, keeping the extinguisher 
aimed at the base of the fire. Sweep back and forth until the flames appear to be out. 
 
It is essential to aim the extinguisher accurately at the base of the fire and to move the extinguisher back 
and forth slowly in a sweeping motion. It is equally important to hold the extinguisher upright.  
Extinguishers will not work properly when tilted or turned upside down. 
 
FIRE SAFETY TRAINING PROGRAM 
 
Staff shall have specific responsibilities during Fire Emergencies — both drills and actual fires.  
 
This education and training may be accomplished through:

detector, manual pull station, or sprinkler head is activated anywhere in the hospital, the alarm site is 
displayed on monitors located in PBX, Plant Services, and Nurse Stations.  The display specifies the location 
which originated the alarm and whether it is a fire alarm or sprinkler alarm.  At the same time, the Code RED 
audio and visual alarms will activate.  
The alarm light will remain illuminated until cleared and reset by PBX.  They will be silenced by PBX as 
directed by the proper authority. All alarms will be reset in PBX after the cause of the alarm is investigated. 
 
Notification: 
1. Upon receiving the notification call of the fire and location, the PBX page operator will clearly 
announce three times: “Code RED, location”. 
2. The PBX operator will call and/or page the Administrator on Call (AOC) to notify them of the 
event and radio to Plant Services (when available) for status.  
3. Once Plant Services, House Manager, or Security has informed PBX that the fire incident has 
been resolved, the PBX operator will clearly announce three times: “All Clear, Code RED, 
location”. 
 
Fire Suppression System 
 
A. Automatic water sprinkler system has sprinkler heads located throughout most of the facility. The 
sprinklers are spontaneous; they are activated automatically whenever the environment reaches 
critical mass due to heat However, a few areas are serviced by other types of fire suppression systems 
which are automatically activated whenever a temperature sensing device reaches a certain 
temperature.:
