Origination: May 1997 Review Date: 10/31/2024 
Revision Date: 06/06/2018,10/31/24 
      
PURPOSE: 
To provide a safe physical environment for patients, staff, and visitors at all Our Lady of the Lake Health 
(OLOL) network locations. 
POLICY: 
OLOL has designed and engineered through the use of automated transfer switches, emergency generators and 
alternative feeds to prevent total and/or partial loss of electrical supply. 
PROCEDURES: 
 Partial Loss (loss of one feeder) 
1. All emergency generators will cycle on immediately at the time of the outage. 
2. Ensure activation of the automatic tie switch at the control board of incoming feeds. 
3. All emergency generators will cycle off or time out if tie switch is successful. 
4. Verify failed power with Entergy utilities dispatch.  1-800-766-1648 Entergy Business Office. 
5. Call Entergy account representative to get a report of failure and ETA on any repairs. 
6. Perform retransfer to normal operations, (both feeds used) once the danger of re-failure is over and at a 
time convenient to the hospital. 
Total Loss (loss of both feeders) 
All emergency generators will cycle on immediately at the time of the outage. 
1. Ensure operation of all emergency generators.  
2. Ensure all transfer switches have transferred to "emergency positions". 
3. At time of a total feeder failure, Natural gas generators will start simultaneously. 
4. Automatic sequencing of natural gas generators will begin. 
5. Switchgear will automatically start to connect hospital loads to the generator bus. 
6. Emergency generators will cycle off automatically. 
7. The hospital will be on full generator power. 
8. Monitor capacity so the system does not go into priority shed sequence.
