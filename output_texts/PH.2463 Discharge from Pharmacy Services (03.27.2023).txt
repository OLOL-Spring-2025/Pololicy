SCOPE: 
Applies to team members who work in or for Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Inc. (OLOLH) retail/community 
pharmacies and only applies to specialty pharmacies designated as such in the NCPDP database. 
PURPOSE: 
This policy assures that patients that are no longer using the pharmacy’s services are appropriately discharged. 
 
POLICY: 
In the course of pharmacy operations, it is fairly common for patients to complete a course of therapy or even change 
pharmacy providers.  A formal discharge process is rare for community or specialty pharmacies. The pharmacy does not 
require a formal discharge process; however, the patient record will reflect the discharge-related activities and the 
patient’s or employee’s comments when warranted.

the following:
