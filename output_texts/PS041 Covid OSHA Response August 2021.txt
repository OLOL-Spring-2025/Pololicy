Revision Date:  
Review Date:  
Reference # PS041 Origin Date: August 2021 
 
PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this policy to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19, in accordance with OSHA’s 
COVID-19 Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS). equipment and structures  
 
PROCEDURES: 
A. Physical Barriers 
 
Physical barriers will be implemented, along with the other provisions required by OSHA’s COVID-19 
ETS, as part of a multi-layered infection control approach in areas of greatest need and risk of 
transmission. 
 
Where feasible, Our Lady of the Lake will ensure that: 
• Physical barriers are solid and made from impermeable materials; 
• Physical barriers are easily cleanable or disposable;  
• Physical barriers are sized (i.e., height and width) and located to block face-to-face pathways 
between individuals based on where each person would normally stand or sit;  
• Physical barriers are secured so that they do not fall or shift, causing injury or creating a trip or 
fall hazard;  
• Physical barriers do not block workspace air flow or interfere with the heating, ventilation, and 
air conditioning (HVAC) system operation; 
• Physical barriers are transparent in cases where employees and others have to see each other for 
safety; and 
• Physical barriers do not interfere with effective communication between individuals. 
 
Physical barriers are/will be installed in areas such as:  
• Patient registration bays 
• Patient check-in 
• Cafeteria 
 
Physical barriers may be free-standing on the floor and secured; mounted securely to hard surfaces above 
the floor (e.g., benches, desks, countertops, production lines, vehicle interior surfaces); or hung from 
above and extending down from the ceiling or other fixture and secured so as not to fall, flap, or move.  
 
B. Ventilation 
 
Our Lady of the Lake will ensure that:  
 
• The HVAC system(s) is used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and the design 
specifications of the HVAC system(s); 
• The amount of outside air circulated through the HVAC system(s) and the number of air changes per hour

are maximized to the extent appropriate;  
• All air filters are rated Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or higher, if compatible with 
the HVAC system(s); if not compatible, the filter with the highest compatible filtering efficiency is used; 
• All air filters are maintained and replaced as necessary to ensure the proper function and performance of 
the HVAC system;  
• All intake ports that provide outside air to the HVAC system(s) are cleaned, maintained, and cleared of 
any debris that may affect the function and performance of the HVAC system(s); and 
• Existing airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs), if any, are maintained and operated in accordance 
with their design and construction criteria.
