PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this policy is to address a reduction in size or closure of an OLOL sponsored graduate 
medical education program or closure of the Sponsoring Institution.  
 
POLICY: 
A. In the event that there is closure of the Sponsoring Institution, or if the Sponsoring Institution 
intends to close or to reduce the size of an Our Lady of the Lake sponsored graduate medical 
education program, the Sponsoring Institution will inform the GMEC, DIO, and House 
Officers as soon as possible of the reduction or closure.   
 
B. In the event of reduction or closure, the Sponsoring Institution and training program will make 
reasonable efforts to allow residents already enrolled in the residency program to complete their 
education. Should circumstances prevent this, residents will be provided with assistance in 
securing positions in ACGME-accredited program in which they may continue their education.
