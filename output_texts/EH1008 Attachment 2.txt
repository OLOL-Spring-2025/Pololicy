Consent for Meningococcal Prophylaxis 
 
 
I, ________________________________, understand that I am being treated for an exposure to a patient  
                                 Print name  
diagnosed with Meningococcal meningitis/sepsis.  Based on CDC recommendations, prophylaxis is only 
recommended for healthcare workers with intimate exposure to nasopharyngeal secretions, such as occurs 
with unprotected mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, intubation, or suctioning, before antibiotic therapy was 
initiated.  Recommended prophylaxis consists of one of the following antibiotics: 
 
 
 Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth in one single dose (contraindicated if pregnant)  
OR 
 Rifampin 600 mg twice daily for 2 days (contraindicated if pregnant) 
OR 
 Rocephin (Cephtriaxone) 250 mg IM, in one single dose (OK during pregnancy)  
 
 
Please list any allergies: _________________________________________________________________ 
 
Are you pregnant or breastfeeding?             Yes                          No 
If pregnant, DO NOT give Ciprofloxacin or Rifampin.  If pregnant, a note will be required from 
the employee’s physician giving permission to take Rocephin.  If the exposure occurs on the 
weekend, the employee will consult with the Lake After Hours or Emergency Room physician for 
recommendations regarding the risks/benefits of prophylaxis during pregnancy.  If breastfeeding, 
the employee will contact their pediatrician for recommendations. 
 
I do not have an allergy to the selected antibiotic.  I understand that it is my responsibility to have the 
prescription filled and to take the full course of treatment prescribed. 
 
If any side effects develop (rash, vomiting, diarrhea or any other symptoms) after I start this medication, I 
will discontinue the medication, call my primary care physician and notify Employee Health.  If I develop 
any signs/symptoms of meningitis/sepsis (fever, body aches/chills, neck stiffness, rash), I will go to the 
Emergency Room or call my primary care physician right away and notify Employee Health.

DECLINATION: 
I choose not to take the recommended prophylaxis.  I understand that if I develop any symptoms of 
Meningococcal meningitis/sepsis (fever, body aches/chills, neck stiffness, rash), I must contact my 
physician right away or go to the Emergency Room.  I will also notify my supervisor and Employee Health 
and will not be allowed to work until I have been cleared by a physician and Employee Health.
