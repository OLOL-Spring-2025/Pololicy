Activation Process of the Family Center for No-Notice Incidents 
The following outlines a basic process for the establishment of a family center within the hospital: 
• Incident occurs in the community. 
• Families and friends arrive at the hospital. 
• Activate family center (team and room). 
• Security stops media from entering the hospital and family center. 
• Checkpoint established to vet family/friends (ID check & Badging). 
• Welcome area established at the front of the family center. 
• Provide regular updates (every 30/60 minutes). 
• Allow them to see their loved ones once confirmed (Family/friends escorted to patients room.) 
VIP Visits 
• Identify Patient Experience team member to do introductions:  
o Be a support 
o Consent approvals  
• Media should have a liaison(communications team) that works closely with Patient Experience Team 
• Determine VIP Tiers (team member/patient) whether or not the executive leadership team needs to be involved 
• Use Proactive approach to who could come and days that would be convenient  13 
Incident On-set (Beginning of the Incident) 
• Back door approach/ parking plan/valet/media/security 
• Isolate families/ private area for them. 
o Have proxy provide contact list/ determine the number of immediate family members able to visit. 
• All rooms with MCI patients should be run like an ICU, including being escorted to patient room.  
• Tighter security when guest try to visit patient e.g. 
o Name? 
o Location? 
o How are you related? 
• Letter of explanation and expectation given (different translations needed)  
o PowerPoint “our goal is to…” social media/privacy tips/ explain the why if asked 
• If family/ patient wish to meet with the media it must be coordinated through OLOLRMC Communications.  
• Fast Pass/ log and sign in at the designated entrance. 
• When identified separate them by acuity/different needs 
• Strategic with VIP visits based on timing and the patent’s needs.  
 
Donations (Food, Gifts, Service & Monetary) Recommendations 
In the days that followed the Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, 2016, Orlando Health received hundreds of inquiries from 
individuals and groups around the country that wanted to offer help. Many offered to send care packages, arrange for catered 
meals, or send monetary donations to assist the families affected. Hundreds more sent cards and letters for the victims, their 
family members, and Orlando Health team members. Through a combined effort, a procedure was quickly put into action for the 
acceptance and distributing of these donations. During the debrief sessions, it was agreed upon that a more efficient process

in-kind donations of food. 
▪ If incident was a terrorist incident or other major criminal act do not accept food donations due to fears 
of contamination/poisoning. 
▪ Work with PxP Department to establish a list of the reputable restaurants that want to donate.  Once a 
need arises PxP Department should work with the restaurant to obtain food donations.  This includes an 
OLOLRMC team member going to the restaurant to pick up and deliver the food donations. 
o Have an easy-to-access web page prepared with a list of all of the ways to help, to which all inquiries can be 
directed. This page will be made live in the event of such a crisis. It will also include the contact information of 
the liaisons mentioned above. Work in partnership with the Foundation to have this site created in a timely

and to provide meal coverage for the families. The Food & Nutrition and Plant Services/ EVS 
representatives should be involved with designating a space for serving the food and cleaning 
the space in between deliveries.

Services from Unaffiliated Volunteers: 
 
Unaffiliated volunteers, spontaneous volunteers, are individuals who offer to help or self-deploy to assist in emergency 
situations without fully coordinating their activities.  They are considered unaffiliated because they are not part of a disaster 
relief organization or at least one that OLOLRMC regularly works with.  Although unaffiliated volunteers can be significant 
resources, they do not have a pre-established relationship with our organization.  OLOLRMC would have to verify their training 
or credentials and match them with the appropriate service area if they were going to use them.  Unaffiliated volunteers should 
not be allowed into patient care areas or the family center without proper vetting and credentialing beforehand.
