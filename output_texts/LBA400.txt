PURPOSE 
To define the scope of Outreach business and outline the responsibility of OLOLRMC 
Main and Affiliate Laboratories in the Outpatient testing process. 
 
POLICY 
FMOLHS is in partnership with LabCorp, a nationally recognized laboratory, which 
provides testing for FMOLHS Outpatient specimens. Outreach service includes 
Registration, Client Services, Outreach LIS, multiple Client Service Centers (draw sites), 
and multiple testing laboratories. 
 
An Outreach Patient is defined as a person who has not been admitted into an FMOLHS 
Hospital as an inpatient but requires testing services provided by a patient testing 
laboratory. 
 
In order to continue to provide timely and quality patient care for the outreach patients in 
our communities a reverse lab testing agreement has been reached with LabCorp.  
Through the reverse lab testing agreement, and at the discretion of LabCorp, Outreach 
specimens may be routed to OLOLRMC Main or Affiliate Labs for testing.  The list of 
tests mutually agreed upon is available for reference on the “Reverse Lab Test List” and 
is posted within the lab.
