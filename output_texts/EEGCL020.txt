Purpose:  
The purpose of this policy is to outline the procedure for ordering and obtaining long term 
epilepsy monitoring studies. 
 
Policy: 
Prior to any LTEM testing the ordering physician must have a designated on staff neurologist to 
read the study.  This will be facilitated by the ordering physician speaking directly to the 
interpreting neurologist prior to the order being placed.  The EEG technician will contact this 
neurologist prior to the initiation of the study.  In the absence of an interpreting neurologist the 
study will not be performed.  The EEG technician will notify the ordering physician if their order 
does not meet this requirement.   
 
Procedure: 
 
The Ordering physician will speak with the interpreting neurologist prior to placing the order.  
Once the order is placed the EEG technician will contact the interpreting neurologist to let them 
know they have started the study.  If for any reason the EEG technician is unable to perform the 
study they will notify both the ordering physician and the interpreting neurologist.
