Formulated By:  Cardiovascular Services / Infection Control 
 
Purpose: To provide a technique for gowning and gloving following the 
surgical hand scrub 
 
Applies To:  All CVL Personnel 
 
Policy:  Gowning and gloving should be performed prior to touching sterile 
 equipment or the sterile field. 
 
Procedure:   Refer to facility designated on-line clinical reference   
 
1.   Gowning and gloving:  
a. Gown for the scrub nurse/tech who will be establishing the sterile set-up should 
be located away from the sterile table. 
b. The wrappers containing the gown and the gloves should be opened aseptically to 
create a sterile area from which they can be retrieved.  
 
2. Drying of the hands and arms: 
a. The towel should be grasped firmly and lifted straight up and away from sterile 
field without dripping water onto the sterile field. 
b. The person should step away and bend slightly forward at the waist, holding the 
hands and elbows above the waist and away from the body.  The towel should be 
allowed to unfold to its full length and width. 
c. The top half of the towel should be held securely with one hand and the opposite 
fingers and hand blotted dry, making sure they are thoroughly dried before 
moving to the forearm. 
d. A rotating motion should be used going up the arm toward the elbow. Once an 
area is dried, it should not be revisited. 
e. The lower end of the towel should be grasped with the dried hand and the same 
procedure should be used for drying the second hand and forearm.  
f. The towel should be discarded into the appropriate hamper.

If a waterless antimicrobial cleanser is used, apply according to the manufacturer’s 
directions. 
3. Putting on the sterile gown: 
a. The sterile gown is grasped at the neckline with both hands and lifted from the 
sterile field.  The person steps into an area where the gown may be opened 
without risk of contamination. 
b. The gown should be spread open and the hands and arms inserted into the sleeves. 
c. The hands should not emerge outside of the gown cuffs if a "closed" gloving 
method is to be used. 
 
4. Gloving 
a. "Closed" gloving: 
1) The cuff of the glove is laid over the cuff of the gown.  The glove cuff is 
held securely by the hand (which is under the gown cuff) on which it has 
been placed, the opposite hand (also under the gown cuff) stretches the 
glove cuff opening over the sleeve opening entirely. 
2) The gown cuff with the glove is then pulled toward the body keeping the 
cuff covered by the glove. The fingers are directed into their position and 
the glove is adjusted. 
3) The gloved hand then positions the remaining glove on the opposite sleeve 
in the same fashion as above.  Gloves should be wiped with a wet towel to 
remove glove powder if present. 
b. "Open" method includes: 
1) Gowned person may use this method when it is necessary to change only 
one glove.  If both gloves need to be changed and there is no sterile person 
to assist, the gowned person must remove the gown then the gloves, and 
then re-gown and glove. 
2)    The gowned person may cover a single contaminated glove using the 
“open” method by placing the remaining sterile hand under the cuff of the 
replacement glove and pulling the glove over the contaminated glove.  The 
cuff of the replacement glove should be adjusted to completely cover the 
underlying glove. 
 
5. Assisting others with gowning and gloving: 
a. The gown is opened by the sterile scrub person as described previously.  The 
inner side of the gown is held opened toward the individual who is to be gowned.   
b. A cuff is made of the neck and shoulder area to protect the gloved person. 
c. The gown is held until the person's hands and forearms are in the sleeves of the 
gown.  
d. The circulating nurse pulls the gown onto the shoulders, adjusting the back and 
securing the ties. 
e. The scrub person grasps the glove under the everted cuff. 
f. The palm of the glove is turned toward the other individual's hand. 
g. The cuff is stretched to open the glove.  The scrub person keeps their fingers 
within the cuff to prevent contamination. 
h. The hand is inserted into the glove.  3 
i. The gowned person brings the cuff over the gown cuff. 
j. Procedure is repeated for other hand. 
k. The wrap around back on the gown is fixed by the scrub person after the gloving 
is completed. 
6. Removing soiled gown and gloves. 
a. For disposable/paper gowns: 
1) The neck and back ties are broken by pulling on the front of the gown while 
gloves are still on. 
2) After the ties are released, the gown is gasped at one shoulder seam without 
touching the scrub clothes. 
3) The neck of the gown and sleeve are brought forward, over and off the gloved 
hand, turning the gown inside out and inverting the cuff of the glove. 
4) Touching only the outside of the gown, step should be repeated for the other 
side, completely removing the gown. 
5) The gown is held away from the body and folded inside out and discarded into 
the linen trash hamper. 
6) The gloved fingers of one hand are place under the inverted cuff of the other 
glove and the glove is pulled off, inverting it in the process and discard into 
the trash. 
7) The inside fold of the remaining glove is grasped with bare fingers of the 
ungloved hand and the glove is pulled off. 
8) The hands and forearms should be washed.
