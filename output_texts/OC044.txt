PURPOSE 
To provide guidelines for the timeliness of reporting diagnostic critical results to the licensed healthcare 
provider that can take action on the results. 
 
DEFINITIONS 
1. A physician/designee - is the on-call physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner or physician 
office nurse who has been permitted to accept the results immediately and relay to the ordering 
physician. 
2. Critical Value/Results – These are tests that have a defined upper or lower limit panic or critical 
value or a critical finding that could significantly impact a patient’s well-being.  These are generally 
considered to be the initial first-time diagnostic results that are considered to be immediately or 
potentially life, limb or organ threatening, thus requiring an urgent response. 
 
POLICY 
Critical values/results are to be reported to the physician/designee within 60 minutes of being resulted.  
 
PROCEDURES 
 
Laboratory: 
1. Laboratory personnel will immediately call the nurse responsible for the patient upon the 
identification of all critical values/results. (OLOL Critical Values List)  
2. The laboratory technologist will ask the nurse to read back the results to verify that they were 
understood correctly. 
3. Lab personnel will record the nurse’s first and last name, time and read back.   
4. The nurse will initiate action based on existing protocols/orders or contact the physician/designee 
within 60 minutes of receipt of the critical result.   
5. The nurse will ask the physician/designee to read back the results to verify that they were understood 
correctly. 
6. The nurse will document in the medical record the test results received, the time the 
physician/designee was notified, the read back of values/results and the orders received or the 
actions taken per protocol/orders. 
7. When the patient’s test results remain within the Critical Value range within a 48-hour period the 
results are not called, unless requested by a physician. These results are documented with the 
statement indicating results match previous test results. However, when a significant change in the 
patient’s test results occurs within 48 hours the results are called.

Critical Radiology Results 
1. The radiologist will communicate critical results to the ordering physician/designee.  
2. The radiologist will ask the physician/designee to read back the results to verify that they were 
understood correctly.   
3. The radiologist will document in the procedure report the person and the time of notification. 
 
Critical Respiratory Results 
1. The Respiratory Therapist will report critical respiratory results to the physician/nurse.   
2. The Respiratory Therapist will either directly hand the results or phone the results to the 
physician/nurse.   
3. When phoning results, the therapist will ask the physician/nurse to read back the results to verify that 
they were understood correctly. 
4. The Respiratory Therapist will document, in the medical record, the time of notification, read back 
of results and who was notified. 
 
Critical Echocardiogram Results 
1. The Study should be ordered as STAT 
2. The cardiologist must be notified by the ordering physician to discuss indication. 
3. The Echo tech will document in the medical record and notify the cardiologist when completed with 
the preliminary report. 
4. The cardiologist will contact the ordering physician once interpreted.  
 
Critical EKG Results 
5. When EKG results are obtained that match the defined critical values (OLOL Critical Values List) it 
is to be immediately selected from file manager and printed.   
6. The EKG tech will notify the patient’s physician, primary nurse, or charge nurse. The primary nurse 
or charge nurse is then responsible for notifying the physician.  
7. The clinician will document in the medical record the EKG results, time the physician/designee was 
notified, and whether physician orders were received. 
8. Any orders received will be read back to the physician/designee for verification. 
9. Critical EKG values are to be communicated to the physician immediately, maximum of 15 minutes 
from completion to relay of information.   
10. If after two attempts, the ordering physician or designee cannot be reached, a Rapid Response should 
be initiated. 
11. If the patient exhibits acute symptoms, a code blue should be initiated while the call is being placed 
to the physician.  
12. EKG done in the clinic setting will follow policy OC021.  
Critical Values / Results List- These are minimum guidelines. Situations, which do not fit these criteria, but 
may reasonably be interpreted as critical situations, are to be handled the same as above.
