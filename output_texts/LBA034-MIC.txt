POLICY 
Quality Assurance (QA) is the systematic process of monitoring and evaluating various aspects 
of the laboratory to ensure that specified requirements are consistently being met.  Molecular 
Microbiology testing requires focused monitoring for the presence of false positive results 
particularly due to contamination. 
 
This policy is specifically intended to address the molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing being 
performed by OLOLRMC Main and Affiliate Laboratories.  See form LBA034-A – OLOLRMC 
and Affiliate Labs COVID19 Test Methodologies for current covid testing performed in each lab.  
The OLOLRMC Main Lab Molecular Department has specific procedures in place that address 
its larger and more comprehensive test menu which will take precedence over this policy. 
 
PROCEDURE 
A report is generated from the LIS monthly for each lab that performs SARS-CoV-2 testing.  
The percentage of positive vs negative results is calculated and assessed.   
The following will be evaluated: 
• Increases above 20% that do not correlate with community hospitalization and 
positivity rates  
• Increases compared to other OLOLRMC system labs 
• Increases compared to historical lab positivity rate 
Corrective Action for increased positivity rates due to suspected false positive results: 
• Instrument will be cleaned per manufacturer’s instruction  
• Take an environmental swab and run a test on the instrument 
• Repeat QC  
• If the above steps do not correct the issue contact manufacturer for guidance if needed 
All evaluation, corrective action, and follow-up as needed will be documented.
