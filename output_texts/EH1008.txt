MENINGOCOCCAL EXPOSURE EMPLOYEE INFORMATION 
 
Transmission of Neisseria meningitis to hospital personnel taking care of patients with meningococcemia, 
meningococcal meningitis, or meningococcal lower respiratory infection is uncommon. 
 
Antibiotic prophylaxis (the taking of a specific antibiotic to minimize the risk of contracting this infection) is 
indicated for the following groups of people: 
 
1. Household contacts; parents and siblings 
2. Hospital personnel who intubated or administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
3. Hospital personnel who had intensive direct contact with respiratory secretions and who did 
not use proper protective precautions. 
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS:  
 
1. A history of previous allergic reaction to any of the prophylactic medications is a contraindication. 
Please notify ECU physician of any allergies. 
 
 2. Pregnant employees should report their condition to Employee Health and the ECU physician.  
Assessment will be provided in conjunction with their personal physician. 
 
OTHER PRECAUTIONS: 
 
 1. Rifampin may decrease the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy of the Coumadin type.  If 
employee is on Coumadin this should be reported to the assessment nurse. 
 
 2. Rifampin may impair the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills).  Alternate 
contraceptive methods may need to be considered. 
 
 3. Urine, feces, saliva, sputum, sweat and tears maybe colored red-orange by Rifampin.  Soft contact 
lenses maybe permanently stained. 
 
OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS/SIDE EFFECTS: 
 
 1. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as heartburn, epigastric distress, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gas, 
cramp, and diarrhea have been reported and are common in some patients receiving Rifampin. 
 
 2. Headaches, drowsiness, fatigue, menstrual disturbances, ataxia, dizziness, inability to concentrate, 
mental confusion, visual disturbances, muscular weakness, fever, pains in the extremities and 
generalized numbness have also been noted. 
 
 3. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.  Pruritus, urticaria, rash, pemphigoid reaction, 
eosinophilia, sore mouth/tongue and exudative conjunctivitis may occur in some allergic reactions.

Consent for Meningococcal Prophylaxis 
 
I, ________________________________, understand that I am being treated for an exposure to a patient  
                                 Print name  
diagnosed with Meningococcal meningitis/sepsis.  Based on CDC recommendations, prophylaxis is only 
recommended for healthcare workers with intimate exposure to nasopharyngeal secretions, such as occurs with 
unprotected mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, intubation, or suctioning, before antibiotic therapy was initiated.  
Recommended prophylaxis consists of one of the following antibiotics: 
 
 Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth in one single dose (contraindicated if pregnant) 
OR 
 Rifampin 600 mg twice daily for 2 days (contraindicated if pregnant) 
OR 
 Rocephin (Cephtriaxone) 250 mg IM, in one single dose (OK during pregnancy) 
 
Please list any allergies: _________________________________________________________________ 
 
Are you pregnant or breastfeeding?             Yes                          No 
If pregnant, DO NOT give Ciprofloxacin or Rifampin.  If pregnant, a note will be required from the 
employee’s physician giving permission to take Rocephin.  If the exposure occurs on the weekend, the 
employee will consult with the Lake After Hours or Emergency Room physician for recommendations 
regarding the risks/benefits of prophylaxis during pregnancy.  If breastfeeding, the employee will contact 
their pediatrician for recommendations. 
 
I do not have an allergy to the selected antibiotic.  I understand that it is my responsibility to have the prescription 
filled and to take the full course of treatment prescribed. 
 
If any side effects develop (rash, vomiting, diarrhea or any other symptoms) after I start this medication, I will 
discontinue the medication, call my primary care physician and notify Employee Health.  If I develop any 
signs/symptoms of meningitis/sepsis (fever, body aches/chills, neck stiffness, rash), I will go to the Emergency 
Room or call my primary care physician right away and notify Employee Health.

DECLINATION: 
I choose not to take the recommended prophylaxis.  I understand that if I develop any symptoms of 
Meningococcal meningitis/sepsis (fever, body aches/chills, and neck stiffness, rash), I must contact my physician 
right away or go to the Emergency Room.  I will also notify my supervisor and Employee Health and will not be 
allowed to work until I have been cleared by a physician and Employee Health.
