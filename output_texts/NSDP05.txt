STAFFING POSITION PLAN 
 
The Nutritional Services Department is staffed with 168.8 FTE's according to the FY 18 
budget.  The number is derived from benchmarking within the industry using the Lakes and 
USF primary benchmarking tool of Action O-I through VHA.  The numbers are compared 
to the US Food Service data base, the largest healthcare data base regarding staffing 
statistics and efficiencies.  The numbers are also collated with HFM (Healthcare 
Foodservice Management Association) the largest professional association of the healthcare 
food service executives.  We correlate this with our patient satisfaction, employee 
satisfaction, DHH scores and financial viability.  The following staffing plan has been 
established:
