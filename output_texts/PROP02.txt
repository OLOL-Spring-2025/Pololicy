Patient selection and evaluation 
 
Referral resources include patient inquiries, physician referrals, pulmonary staff,   
and physician orders for Pulmonary Rehabilitation Consult. 
 
Multi-discipline assessment  
 
All patients will be assessed by rehabilitation staff during the preliminary pulmonary rehabilitation sessions. 
Multi-discipline assessment includes: 
 • Medical history and Nursing assessment 
 • Exercise assessment 
 • Respiratory assessment 
 • Psychosocial Assessment 
 • Six minute walk test 
 • Goals development 
 • Development of individualized treatment plan 
 
  
Orientation 
 
All patients will attend an orientation session prior to the first exercise session.  The purpose of the 
orientation session is: 
 
 1. A time for the professional staff to gain insight into the patient's medical history, needs, and goals. 
 2. A time for the patient and family to gain a further insight into the outpatient pulmonary 
  rehabilitation process and to have questions answered and concerns addressed. 
 
The orientation process includes: 
 • Introduction of staff and patient 
 • Discussion of medical history and current medications 
 • Distribution of early education materials 
 • Review exercise and education schedules 
 • Review symptoms to report and termination of exercise criteria  • Discuss exercise sequence (warm-up, cardiovascular work, cool-down) and proper/ safe use of 
  exercise equipment. 
 • Tour of facility 
 • Demonstrate use of telemetry, pulse oximeter, and oxygen 
 • Assessment by nursing, exercise, and respiratory staff and formulation of individualized goals. An 
  initial assessment will be completed during the patient orientation.  All other assessments,  
  including the six-minute walk test should be completed within the first week of the patient’s 
  rehabilitation program. 
 • Obtain baseline measures: oxygen saturation, ECG, resting heart rate,  SF-36 
  test, Six Minute Walk Test, completion of patient questionnaire. 
 
Exercise Therapy 
 
A treatment plan to accomplish goals will be individualized according to the patient's needs and degree of 
respiratory disability as assessed by pulmonary function tests, preliminary functional capacity, and exercise  
responses.  Goals will be established that are objective, measurable, and functional as possible, anticipating  
the overall frequency and duration of service for the patient. 
 
Education & Support 
 
Pulmonary rehabilitation education is a part of the  pulmonary rehabilitation sessions. Topics to be 
covered may include: lung function, pulmonary disease process and pathophysiology, breathing techniques,  
pulmonary nutrition, behavior modification/stress management, bronchial hygiene, medications, Activities  
for Daily Living, and use of Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI).  Instruction will be provided by a respiratory  
therapist. 
  
 
Discharge Planning 
 
Once the patient has completed the outpatient program, a discharge summary will be completed.  Discharge 
planning includes: 
 
 • Six minute walk test follow-up 
 • Follow-up completion of the Medical Outcomes Trust Short form (SF-36) 
 • Entry into Pulmonary Maintenance program 
 • Development of a home-based program for self-care 
 • Patient evaluation  of program 
 • Review and documentation of goals and objectives met 
 • Final report of the patient's functional capacity and education
