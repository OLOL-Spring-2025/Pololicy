DEFINITION:  SYNtrac Department Management System: A product of Cardinal Health that is used by

2. Super Users will audit employees who have access to SYNtrac on an annual basis. If it is 
determined by the Super User that an employee no longer needs access to SYNtrac then that 
user’s access will be terminated.

to SYNtrac immediately.
