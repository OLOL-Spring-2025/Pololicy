POLICY: Determining the appropriate length of stay in intense, in-patient rehabilitation is dependent upon 
several factors.  Though an attempt is made to estimate length of stay during initial evaluation, 
this can only be considered a suggestion based on the likelihood that the client’s recovery from 
illness and ability to benefit from rehabilitation will follow expected time- lines. 
 The sum of the factors that impinge upon this decision include: 
1. Ability to participate in an intense program of rehabilitation 
2. The establishment of realistic, achievable goals that will lead to a significant improvement in 
the client’s ability to care for himself, and  
3. The necessity that the intensity of an in-patient program be provided in order to achieve 
agreed upon goals 
 
It is recognized that some client’s recovery from illness will be slower than expected and/or their 
ability to participate and make progress in rehabilitation will not be as great as had originally 
been hoped for.  These individuals, in whom further progress towards established goals unlikely, 
would also be appropriate for discharge. 
 
 Finally, recognizing that rehabilitation is an on-going process, and that some clients respond 
better to in-patient settings while others respond better to home or outpatient settings, we 
recognize the need to modify patient’s setting appropriately.  An individual who can continue to 
make progress towards established goals in a setting of reduced intensity such as the home or the 
convalescent home should be allowed to do so once such a change in setting is recognized to be 
appropriate.
