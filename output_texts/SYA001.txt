PURPOSE: 
 
To establish staffing standards for the ENDO/GI LAB in which safety and cost 
effectiveness are both maintained. 
 
POLICY:   
 
1. Minimally, one RN will be present during pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and post 
procedure phases of care. An additional RN and/or ENDO TECH will be available 
depending on case/procedure. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
1. The RN in charge of the unit will make daily assignments. 
2. RN staffing decisions will be based on patient age, functional ability, and comorbidities. 
Number, variety, and complexity of procedures will also be considered. RN experience and 
staff skill mix are also included in decision making. 
3. When an anesthesia provider is administering the sedation, the RN will remain to provide 
continuity of care, document, and assist the healthcare team. 
4. RNs administering procedural sedation must not have other responsibilities that would 
compromise their ability to adequately monitor the patient before, during, and after the 
procedure (ANA, 2008). These procedural sedation cases will be allocated an additional 
RN. 
5. More difficult cases including BRONC, ERCP, PEG/PEJ, EUS, EBUS, STRETTA, 
BARRX, and large polyp removal will also be allocated an additional RN. 
6. Staffing for all other cases/procedures will include an RN and ENDO TECH.
