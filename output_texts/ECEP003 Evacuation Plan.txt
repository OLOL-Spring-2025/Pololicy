Purpose: 
The Evacuation Plan is to provide for the safety of the patients, visitors, staff and guests in certain 
emergency situations that may require partial or total evacuation of the Medical Center.  
Policy:  
The Evacuation Plan will be used in conjunction with the Emergency Operations Plan (ECEP001) to 
guide the hospital’s preparation and response in the event of an evacuation.  
 
Definitions 
One of three types of evacuations may be required: 
• HORIZONTAL: Movement of all individuals away from the danger area on the same floor. 
• VERTICAL: Movement of all individuals down one or more floors. 
• MASS or TOTAL: Movement of all individuals, including patients, visitors and personnel from the 
building. 
 
Authorization to Activate: 
A. The Administrator on Call (AOC), Chief Operating Officer, or Incident Commander has the authority 
to activate or discontinue the hospital’s evacuation plan when it is determined that the building is not 
safe for patients, visitors or staff. Activation may also occur on the direction of the Fire Department 
or an Explosives Technician in the event a bomb is discovered.   
B. The Administrator on Call will assume the role of Incident Commander and determine which HICS 
positions to activate to respond to the event. 
 
Notification 
A. The AOC/Incident Commander will notify PBX page operator to clearly announce “Attention Please: 
Mr. Travel please report to (location)” to notify the Situation Response Team (see in Response 
Section C.2)  
2 
1. The PBX page operator will make this announcement three (3) times. 
2. The House Manager will contact the PBX page operator to repeat the announcement if necessary.  
B. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Operations Officer (COO) will be notified as soon as 
possible whenever the evacuation plan is activated.  
 
Response 
1. All emergency events will be managed by following the Emergency Operations Plan (ECEP-
001) 
2. See also Department Specific Response: Evacuation and Responsibility Matrix (below). 
A. Order of Evacuation 
1. Patients closest to the danger area will always be moved first. 
2. Patients will be moved in the following order: 
a. Ambulatory Patients - Patients who can ambulate without assistance will be led by 
personnel who have been assigned to supervise and lead the ambulatory patients to the 
safe area. 
b. Ambulatory Patients who require non-medical assistance - Ambulatory patients, who 
can be moved with assistance but do not require medical supervision, will be evacuated 
next. Non-nursing personnel such as available security, maintenance, etc., may be 
utilized. 
c. Non-Ambulatory Patients - Patients who cannot ambulate will be moved by the safest 
and most expeditious means (pushed in bed or stretcher, carried or dragged by mattress, 
blankets, littler, or other conveyance) to the nearest safe area. 
3. Unless the situation dictates otherwise, HORIZONTAL evacuation will be used as the first step 
of any evacuation, followed by VERTICAL evacuation. Mass (TOTAL) evacuation is used as a 
last resort.  
4. Mass (TOTAL) Evacuation  
• Begin evacuation on the top floor; continue downward floor by floor until you reach the 
designated safe area. 
• Do not use elevators unless they have been declared safe by the appropriate authority. If 
elevators have been declared safe, use elevators for non-ambulatory patients. 
• If elevators have not been declared safe, evacuate non-ambulatory patients by using 
litters, blankets, and/or appropriate body carriers. 
• Assist ambulatory patients down the stairs to the designated safe area. All ambulatory 
patients should be instructed to hold hands and form a line during the evacuation process. 
• Assist non-ambulatory patients to the safe area using appropriate transport techniques.  
3 
Use wheelchairs and stretchers when available.  
• Close the door to each patient room and apply tape across the doorframe as each patient 
is evacuated, to indicate that the room is empty.  
B. Alternate Care Site 
1. In a HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL Evacuation, patients and visitors are to be moved to the next 
smoke compartment on the same floor or below the impacted area.  
2. In a Mass or TOTAL Evacuation patients may be moved to safe areas either on or off the hospital 
campus.  
a. On Campus- 
• Move patients and visitors to the closest parking garage or parking lot area.  
• Keep patients and visitors together in groups by patient unit whenever possible.  
• Place patients and visitors in an area that offers shelter from weather.  
b. Off Campus 
• The AOC/ Incident Commander in coordination with the Liaison Officer will 
coordinate transfer of patients to alternate care sites away from the hospital’s campus.  
• The Incident Commander in coordination with the Logistics Section Chief will 
coordinate obtaining transportation to move patients to an alternate care site away 
from the hospital’s campus.

c. Both persons place the patient at the edge of the bed; Person B raises the patient into 
a sitting position. 
d. Person A locks in by putting his/her arms under the patient's armpits and grasping 
his/her wrist with the opposite hand.

patient's legs (his/her back to the patient) grasping the upper part of both legs. 
f. Both persons swing the patient from the bed and remove him/her from the room.

2.  One-Person Rescue:

bedding. 
b. Stabilize one of your legs by placing your thigh against the bed.  This leg stops the

d. Drop to the floor (facing the patient) with one knee on the floor and knee closest to 
the patient's feet held high against the bed for support. 
e. Pull the patient from the bed, resting his/her buttocks on your raised leg. 
f. Gradually sit back, lowering your raised leg until your buttocks touch your heels.  
This allows the patient to slide from your raised leg to the floor (do not attempt to 
lift the patient from your leg to the floor. 
g. When the patient is on the floor, place a blanket under him/her and drag him/her and 
drag him/her feet first from the room.  If there is not time for the blanket, grab the 
patient by the ankles and pull from the room.

the bed. 
c. Grasp the patient's lower legs and move him/her to the edge of the bed.  
5 
d. Stand at a point between the patient's waist and the shoulder and place both your 
legs against the bed.  Place one hand under the patient's shoulder and the other over 
the waist. 
e. Pull the top part of the patient's body to the edge of the bed. 
f. Kneel at the same location (still between the patient's waist and shoulder), roll the 
patient's upper body toward your chest and lower him/her to the floor.
