TABLE 5 
COMPONENTS OF A PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENT 
(Adapted from MMWR 2003; 52 [RR-10]) 
 
I. Patients: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) only  
• Maintain in PE room except for required diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that cannot be performed 
in the room, e.g., radiology, operating room  
• Respiratory protection e.g., N95 respirator, for the patient when leaving PE during periods of 
construction  
II. Standard and Expanded Precautions  
• Hand hygiene observed before and after patient contact  
• Gown, gloves, mask NOT required for Health Care Workers (HCWs) or visitors for routine entry into the 
room  
• Use of gown, gloves, mask by HCWs and visitors according to Standard Precautions and as indicated for 
suspected or proven infections for which Transmission-Based Precautions are recommended  
III. Engineering  
• Central or point-of-use HEPA (99.97% efficiency) filters capable of removing particles 0.3 μm in diameter 
for supply (incoming) air  
• Well-sealed rooms  
o Proper construction of windows, doors, and intake and exhaust ports  
o Ceilings: smooth, free of fissures, open joints, crevices  
o Walls sealed above and below the ceiling  
o If leakage detected, locate source and make necessary repairs  
• Ventilation to maintain >12 ACH  
• Directed air flow: air supply and exhaust grills located so that clean, filtered air enters from one side of 
the room, flows across the patient’s bed, exits on opposite side of the room  
• Positive room air pressure in relation to the corridor  
o Pressure differential of >2.5 Pa [0.01” water gauge]  
• Monitor and document results of air flow patterns daily using visual methods (e.g., flutter strips, smoke 
tubes) or a hand-held pressure gauge  
• Self-closing door on all room exits  
• Maintain back-up ventilation equipment (e.g., portable units for fans or filters) for emergency provision 
of ventilation requirements for PE areas and take immediate steps to restore the fixed ventilation system  
• For patients who require both a PE and Airborne Infection Isolation, use an anteroom to ensure proper 
air balance relationships and provide independent exhaust of contaminated air to the outside or place a 
HEPA filter in the exhaust duct. If an anteroom is not available, place patient in an AIIR and use portable 
ventilation units, industrial-grade HEPA filters to enhance filtration of spores. 
IV. Surfaces 
• Daily wet-dusting of horizontal surfaces using cloths moistened with EPA-registered hospital 
disinfectant/detergent  
• Avoid dusting methods that disperse dust  
• No carpeting in patient rooms or hallways  
• No upholstered furniture and furnishings 
 
V. Other  
• No flowers (fresh or dried) or potted plants in PE rooms or areas  
• Use vacuum cleaner equipped with HEPA filters when vacuum cleaning is necessary  IC-3001- Table 5
