Nova StatStrip Wireless Downtime Protocol 
 
The StatStrip meter transmits results automatically to the patient’s electronic medical record via 
a WIFI or when a meter is docked on a designated hard wired docking station labeled 
DOWNLOADER.  
 
In the event the WIFI network is down, periodically the meters will need to be docked on a 
DOWNLOADER to allow communication from meter to HIS to continue until the wireless 
network is back online. Throughout the hospitals there are several DOWNLOADER docking 
stations available to use.  
 
 
DOWNLOADER LOCATIONS are listed in the tables below, please go to the unit nearest you.
