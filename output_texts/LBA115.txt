PURPOSE 
This policy defines specimen referral for OLOLRMC Main and Affiliate Laboratories. 
 
POLICY 
Any testing not performed in-house will be referred to another licensed and/or accredited

laboratory or a laboratory meeting equivalent requirement as determined by CMS.  The 
CLIA Certification numbers for these laboratories are filed in the Laboratory Send -Out 
File kept in the OLORMC Main Laboratory Referrals Department. 
 
As of July 13, 2020, FMOLHS entered into a contract with LabCorp which specifies that 
LabCorp will be the primary referral testing lab for FMOLHS laboratories.
