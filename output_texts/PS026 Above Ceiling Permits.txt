Services before any work is done above any ceiling of any building containing smoke/fire walls which is 
owned by Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) and must receive an “Above-Ceiling 
Permit” prior to commencing any above-ceiling work.  Additionally, any person or persons penetrating 
or damaging any smoke/fire wall in conjunction with their work will repair the smoke/fire wall and 
replace/repair ceilings before release of final payment is made for their services or work.   
 
PROCEDURE: 
Any department contracting for above-ceiling work will inform perspective bidders of our above-ceiling 
work policy, and their need to obtain a permit should they be awarded the contract.  The permit package 
to be obtained from Plant Services before the work can commence will consist of the numbered permit 
and a floor plan, both of which will include pertinent information about the scope of work, route, and 
special precautions to be taken.

It is expected that the contractor will notate any pre-existing conditions to the best of their ability, so that 
OLOL may make effective repairs to said items. Any conditions created by their work above ceiling 
must be corrected immediately prior to closing out the permit. Ceilings will be closed during breaks and 
meals or any time work will stop for a period longer than 30 minutes.  No materials, tools, ladders, etc. 
will be left unattended at any time. Ceiling tiles displaced during investigative or pulling wires will be 
immediately replaced. All dust will be cleaned at the end of each closed ceiling tile. Upon completion, 
area will be vacuumed or cleaned with wet mop.  
ng wires will be immediately replaced. All dust will be cleaned at the end of each closed ceiling tile. 
Upon completion, area will be vacuumed or cleaned with wet mop.  
 
The completed permit information will be reviewed by Plant Services, and the permit will then be 
signed and given to the contractor.  The contractor will post the permit on their ladder at the work site 
and ensure that each of his workers wear their company identification badges at all times while work is

being done.  Anyone who is working above the ceiling without a badge and/or permit will be asked by 
hospital staff to stop work immediately and will not be allowed to restart until the proper permit is 
obtained from Plant Services. 
 
Any questions about the scope of work, method of repair, or permitting shall be addressed to Plant 
Services management staff.  The contractor shall notify same of any deviation from the original scope of 
work. 
 
When the contractor has finished work, he/she will notify Plant Services so a final inspection can be 
done and the permit closed out.  The Plant Services staff inspecting the jobsite will ensure that 
fire/smoke wall integrity has been maintained and inspect for damage to fire-proofing, presence of 
junction box covers, and check for cable attached to sprinkler pipe. The Plant Services staff will also 
verify all trash and debris is removed from the space and ensure that the ceiling grid and tiles are intact 
and in place.  Any necessary repairs to fire/smoke walls will be done in such a way, with approved 
materials, that the integrity of the wall is maintained. Ceiling tiles must be reinstalled immediately after 
walk through is completed. At completion of above ceiling walk through, the above ceiling access 
permit will signed and dated as complete or identified as unsatisfactory. If work is deemed 
unsatisfactory, there will be an additional walk through. It is the obligation of the contractor to schedule 
the walk-through in order that they receive approval.  
 
At no time shall anything be wrapped around, attached, hanging or otherwise to any sprinkler 
piping. Appropriate ladders, scaffolding and work booths must be utilized at all times in a safe manner. 
Plant Services shall be notified 48 hours in advance of any work that will compromise a fire or smoke 
rated wall for more than 4 hours, and a risk assessment will be completed to indicate whether interim 
life safety measures are necessary.  
             
Once the designated Plant Services staff has inspected and accepted the work performed, the permit will 
be closed out.  The contractor will return the permit to Plant Services for completion, at which time the 
designated Plant Services staff will sign the permit, indicating approval for the Accounting Department 
to pay the contractor’s invoice for the work completed. 
 
A log of all permits will be kept on file in the Plant Services office for historical reference. 
 
Contractors working in designated construction areas will be exempt from the permitting process.  
However, if their work requires them to go outside the designated area, the permitting policy will be 
enforced. 
 
The permitting process requirements may also include OLOL staff from departments other than Plant 
Services. 
 
Approved Products:  
Appropriate UL listed materials must be utilized at all times. All penetrations will be sealed in 
accordance with NFPA Standards and Guidelines. An acrylic based firestop sealant that provides 
movement capability in fire rated joint applications, synthetic vitreous fiber and/or a sprayable fire-rated
