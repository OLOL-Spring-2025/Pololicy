Approved by: Date 
 
SCOPE: 
Applies to Patient Access associates across FMOL Health System and its wholly owned 
subsidiaries (“Entity”) licensed as hospitals.  
PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardized process for ensuring all required 
authorizations, prescriptions / medical orders are sent to the Insurance Verification Unit (IVU) 
by 12:00pm the day before a scheduled procedure with the goal of lessening the amount of 
rescheduled patients as the result of a missing authorization or supporting documentation.   
 
DEFINITIONS:  
Medically Necessary Services 
Patients are evaluated for health care services at each Entity regardless of their ability to pay, 
provided that certain non-emergent, elective health care services may be delayed or deferred, in 
accordance with this policy.   
 
Non-Emergent / Scheduled Procedures* 
A scheduled procedure that has been determined delaying/ deferring services will not have an 
adverse patient outcome. 
 
Financially Cleared 
Patients insurance coverage has been reviewed for active insurance coverage, procedure specific 
coverage and potential patient out of pocket expense.  Authorization has been verified for the 
specific procedure(s), facility, physician and date of service.  The above items help ensure the 
claim will be processed timely lessening the potential for an any undue financial hardship for the 
patient that would have resulted from a denial.
