PURPOSE: 
To ensure the safety of patients receiving chemotherapy, new chemotherapy orders received after the cut-
off time of 19:00 will not be prepared by pharmacy until after 06:00 the next morning. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I.  The inpatient pharmacy will use a chemotherapy order cut-off time of 19:00 for the preparation of 
initial chemotherapy doses for Day 1 of therapy. 
II.  Chemotherapy includes the following when used for anti-cancer therapy: cytotoxic medications, 
intravenous monoclonal antibodies, and intravenous biologic therapies. 
III.  A replacement dose of chemotherapy may be prepared after 19:00 in the instance of a damaged 
and/or misplaced scheduled dose. 
IV.  Chemotherapy orders for oncologic emergencies may be prepared after the cut-off time with 
physician orders. Examples of oncologic emergencies requiring chemotherapy include acute 
leukemia patient in blast crisis or aggressive/accelerated/transformed lymphoma patient in 
blast crisis. 
 
Commented [GBM1]: Update to reflect IV pharmacist shift 
end time. Would propose 1900 at the latest since they leave at 
2000. Would also recommend IV room review for this policy if 
not already done.   
 
Commented [GBM2]: Update to reflect IV pharmacist shift 
end time. Would propose 1900 at the latest since they leave at 
2000.   
Commented [GBM3]: Since this can be made by 
technicians and doesn’t have to be made in the chemo room, 
could separate this out from the cut-off. My understanding was 
that the cut off was secondary to there not always being a 
pharmacist in the IV room. Also, don’t have a problem if it 
remains for the sake of consistency.    
Commented [GBM4]: 1900
