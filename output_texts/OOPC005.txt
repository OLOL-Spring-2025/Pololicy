PURPOSE: 
To outline the availability of Communion to the patients of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical 
Center (OLOL). 
 
POLICY: 
OLOL will make Communion available on a regular basis to those patients who desire it. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. Communion for those patients identified as Roman Catholic patients in the electronic medical record 
is ordinarily provided daily by volunteer Extraordinary Ministers of the Eucharist.  
 
2. Patients or families may also contact Pastoral Care to have Communion brought to the patient’s  
room. 
 
3. Communion for Protestant patients will be provided by our Protestant chaplains upon request. 
 
4. Communion will be provided to a confidential patient, by an employee only, upon the patient’s 
request.  
 
5. Generally, any religious representative, with proper training, may distribute Communion to the 
patients of his or her faith.  The Pastoral Care Department should be contacted for clarification on 
this matter.
