Title: Services Not Rendered at OLOL Policy Reference #: OrgClin/024 
Supersedes #: AD/B/012 
Date of Origination: March 22, 1988 Last Review Date:   February 12, 2024 
Last Revision Date:  May 19, 2020 
 
PURPOSE: 
To define when and how patient services not rendered at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center 
(OLOL) are to be done. 
 
POLICY: 
When it is medically necessary for an inpatient to temporarily leave the hospital for treatments or tests 
associated with the current treatment plan, the physician, in collaboration with the testing facility and the 
nursing staff at Our Lady of the Lake, must write a specific order on the patient's chart indicating: 
1. When the patient may leave the hospital 
2. The patient's destination 
3. The purpose of the leave 
4. Who, if anyone, must accompany the patient. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
1. The patient and physician will be required to sign a release of responsibility for leave from the hospital 
for tests, treatments, or consultations prior to leaving the unit.  (See Approval for Temporary Leave for 
Medical Treatment) 
 
2. In order to assist the patient in making an independent decision regarding care, the attending physician 
must explain: 
a. the necessity of the leave the risks and benefits involved 
b. the type of service the other institution will provide  
c. the name of the provider who will be treating them at the other facility  
 
3. If the physicianâ€™s orders do not require an ambulance or other patient-equipped vehicle, patients leaving 
the hospital may be transported by family vehicle or public transportation service.  In the event that 
services are offered in the MOB I or MOB II, the family is responsible for transport of the patient to and 
from the medical plaza. The hospital does not retain responsibility for the patient once the patient has 
left the unit or treatment area, however the patient is not discharged. 
 
4.   If assistance is needed with making transportation arrangements, the physician or nurse should contact 
the Medical Management Department.  If additional assistance is needed, contact the Administrator on 
call.  
 
5. Hospital personnel may be assigned to accompany patients only when emergency procedures must be 
done at another facility.  The House Manager/ Supervisor should be notified prior to a hospital 
employee accompanying a patient to an outside facility.

6. All mental and behavioral health patients will be accompanied by hospital personnel. 
 
7. Should the family request medical assistance above and beyond ambulance personnel, in a 
nonemergency situation, such as private duty nursing; all cost incurred will be the responsibility of the 
patient/family. 
 
8. The unit nurse will record in the electronic medical record under patient information the time the patient 
left the unit, the intended destination, who (if anyone) accompanies the patient, the mode of 
transportation, the patient's physical assessment, including vital signs, just prior to leaving the unit and 
time the patient returned to the unit with a physical assessment, including vital signs, being completed. 
 
9. A photocopy of any medical information required at the testing facility shall be sent with the patient.  
The originals shall be retained in the patient's chart.  Patients under legal status commitments shall have 
their (PEC/CEC/OPC) original documents accompany them. 
 
 
10. Any physician's orders accompanying the patient upon his/her return shall become part of the 
permanent medical record.  These orders shall be reviewed, acted upon and countersigned by the 
patient's attending physician. 
 
11. Unless required to do so by a third-party payor, or by contract arrangement, Our Lady of the Lake 
Regional Medical Center will not bill for procedures performed outside the hospital.  The billing and 
collection of these charges shall be the responsibility of the testing facility.  These bills shall be sent 
directly to the patient.
