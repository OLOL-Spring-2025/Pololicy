end of the day’s schedule. 
2. Surgeons who have an unexpected delay during a case shall not start a TF case if 
the TF procedure is expected to delay the following Surgeon more than 30 
minutes.   The O.R. staff will assist the Surgeon in rescheduling the case.  3 
I. If a surgeon has not started a series of elective cases in time to be completed within 
time allotted, attempts will be made to rearrange time and room assignments for the 
remaining cases to avoid causing delays for other Surgeons.  The Charge Nurse will 
work with the Surgeon to resolve the situation. 
J. To improve utilization of all rooms (block and non-block), if a gap of greater than 
an hour is open, but not adequate time to accommodate a new request, the following 
process will be utilized to accommodate a new request: 
1. The MD with the posted case will be contacted and offered the opportunity to go 
earlier or to follow the new case. 
2. If the MD can not move up, he will be scheduled to follow the new case.  The 
add on case can not cause the originally schedule case to be delayed greater than 
2 hours from the original time. 
K. Communication:
