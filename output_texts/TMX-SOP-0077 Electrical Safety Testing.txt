1.PURPOSE -- SCOPERecognizing that the term "Electrical Safety" refers to a process within the healthcare environment, and not merely a specific procedure, TRIMEDX will collaborate with our customers to help provide an electrically safe environment. One such action in support of the process of Electrical Safety is to complete specific types of testing on electrically powered medical equipment. Electrical safety testing of clinical electrical/electronic devices is the responsibility of TRIMEDX, in accordance with the terms of our specific customer agreements to prevent harm to patients and staff.Leakage current and ground resistance values will be measured during the performance verification and/or maintenance procedures for each device when electrical safety testing is a required component of the inspection(s). Values (outputs) must be recorded on the work order and the indication of pass or fail within limits stated in the criteria section of each testing procedure.Devices that are notin the scope are low voltage battery powered devices and two-pronged devices where visual inspection of cord is acceptable to ensure it is double insulated and intact.2.REFERENCE DOCUMENTS2.1.

6.PROCEDURE6.1.Perform electrical safety testing on electrically powered medical devices during performance verification on new equipment prior to initial clinical use andfollowing repairs and modifications.6.2.NFPA 99, 2012 Testing requirements for electrical equipment within healthcare facilities:6.2.1.Physical Integrityof the power cord by visual inspection6.2.2.Resistancebetween the appliance chassis and ground pin of the attachment plug must be less than 0.50 ohm.6.3.Leakage Current Tests:6.3.1.Fixed Equipment:6.3.1.1.Shall be tested prior to installation while equipment is temporarily insulated from ground; the leakage current flowing through the ground conductor of the power supply to ground of the permanently wired devices shall not exceed 10.0 mA (ac or dc) with all grounds lifted6.3.2.Portable Equipment:6.3.2.1.Touch current for cord-connected equipment shall not exceed 100 microamperes with ground wire intact with normal polarity; shall not exceed 500 microamperes with ground wire disconnected6.3.2.2.Leakage current between all patient leads connected together shall be measured with power plug connected normally and device on; leakage current shall not exceed 100 microamperes for ground wire closed and 500 microamperes for ground wire open6.3.2.3.Use Attachment 1: Summary of Limits for Portable Equipment as a reference.7.QUALITY RECORDS8.PROCESS FLOWCHARTRevisionRevision history6Section 5.2.2 clarified the documentation of safety testing results.Attachment 1 - changed the Chassis Leakage current settings for lab to the NFPA 2012 A.10.5.5.1 requirement of <500uA. Removed the lab exception reference in the Chassis Leakage Current description section.ApprovedStandard Operating ProcedureDocument #: TMX-SOP-0077 Revision: 6Document Type: TMX Effective Date: Nov 9, 2022Department: CE Safety Origination Date: Mar 1, 2009Title: Electrical Safety Testing
