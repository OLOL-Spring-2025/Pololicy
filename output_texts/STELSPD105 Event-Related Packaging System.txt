POLICIES AND PROCEDURES: 
Surgical Services 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE 
April, 1995 
 
NUMBER: 
STELSPD105 
 
SUBJECT:  
Event-Related Packaging: Sterile Supply Procedure for 
Packaging, Coding, Storage, Handling and Recall 
 
Page 1 of 3 
 
 
           
I. PURPOSE: 
To provide guidelines and procedures for packaging, coding, storage, handling and recall 
of sterile supply packages. 
 
II. APPLIES TO: 
Surgical Services, Infection Control, Materials Management, and clinics 
 
III. POLICY: 
It is the policy of the Surgical Services Department that the life of a sterile package or 
sterile item is Event-Related and considered sterile unless the package integrity is 
compromised or contains a manufacturer’s expiration date.  All sterile packaged items 
received from a manufacturer are suitable for use until the expiration date listed or on the 
last day of the listed expiration month.  Any packaging that is soiled, damaged or 
exposed to environmental conditions outside of set range, is considered no longer sterile. 
  
 
 
IV. PROCEDURE: 
 
Event Related Packaging 
1.   Sterility of a packaged item is event related and depends on the quality of the 
wrapper material, the storage conditions, and the conditions during transport, and 
the amount of handling.  Any item that has a torn wrapper, has been compressed, 
or crushed, appears wet, or has been dropped on the floor should not be used.  
2. After sterile processing, the shelf life of a package or sterile item is Event-Related 
and depends on the quality of the wrapper /material at the time of use, the storage, 
conditions during transport, and the amount of handling. 
3. Items purchased from a manufacturer already sterile, should be used according to 
the manufacturer’s directions and expirations.  Items that do not have an 
expiration, will follow the event-related sterility guidelines.   
4. It is the responsibility of each health care worker handling supplies to assess each 
package and its contents to assure that sterile conditions have been maintained. 
 
Identification, Dating and Coding: 
1. All items processed at St. Elizabeth-OLOL Ascension, are to be clearly identified as 
to what contents are packaged. They must be marked with date of sterilization, lot 
control number, sterilizer number, load number, and initials of person packaging the 
item.  The lot control number will serve as a reference in the event of a recall. 
2. Sterilized items will have the date the item was sterilized for rotation of stock. The 
item will remain sterile unless the integrity of the package is compromised or

expiration date reached.   
 Storage of Sterile Supplies: 
1. Store in appropriate area when returned from Sterile Processing.  The storage system 
should be selected based on the environment in which it will be used, the packaging 
materials and systems used, the types of devices packaged, and the handling 
procedures employed.  The ventilation system should be designed so that air flows 
out of sterile storage (via positive pressure). 
2. Shelving or storage carts used for storage are to be maintained in a clean and dry 
condition.  Outside shipping cartons or containers are not allowed in sterile storage 
areas. 
3. Sterile supplies should be stored a minimum of 8 inches off the floor on a solid 
bottom shelf and 18 inches from the ceiling on a top shelf.   
 
Package Checking Procedure: 
1. Surgery personnel are responsible for checking package integrity on instrumentation 
on a monthly basis.  
2.     Maintenance of the sterility of a device to the point of use is essential.  Handling 
packages will be minimized to avoid compromising the sterility of devices during 
storage. 
3. The package is checked for tears, soil, and breaks in integrity before utilization.  If 
any of these are found the package is taken out of use for re-processing. 
4. Dates on all in house processed wrapped and canisters will be checked for expiration 
1 years from the processing date, and the need to keep the item sterile evaluated.   
 
Stock Rotation: 
1. Stock rotation is “first in, first out” and will be practiced as such. 
2. Sterile items from manufacturer will follow the same rotation and package check 
3. Careful handling of items during rotation will increase the life of the package. 
4. Instrument canisters have a shelf expiration of 360 days.  After that time any expired 
instrument canisters will be opened and reprocessed.

Sterility Compromised Package Returns/Recall Packages: 
1. Sterility compromised packages will be returned to Sterile Processing Department for 
reprocessing.  Sterile processing personnel will re-process in-house supplies.  
Materials Management will handle manufacturer supplies and recall process. 
2. Each item or pack contains a lot number which will enable items to be retrieved or 
trace problems back to the source. 
3. In-house recall of surgical instruments will be generated by the Surgical Director. 
When received in Sterile Processing the lot number will be recorded in a logbook 
specific for recall items along with the name of contents, date sterilized the sterilizer 
number, load number, and initials of processor.  The process of determining the 
source of contamination will then be investigated by SPD personnel and the Director 
of Surgical Services, and the Infection Control Coordinator, and appropriate action 
taken to resolve the problem.  All items in-house will be checked for the identified lot 
control number and be pulled out of service at this time. This information can be

found in Censitrac.  
4. Infection Control nurse will be contacted and given the necessary information and 
will determine protocol for surveillance and notification. 
5. Manufacturer recall is generated through the purchasing/Materials department.  Upon 
receiving recall notification, the product and user departments are identified.  A copy 
of this notification is forwarded to each user department.  The user department will 
respond by following the specific instructions designated by the manufacturer.  
Response documentation is filed in the purchasing office after appropriate response 
has been followed.
