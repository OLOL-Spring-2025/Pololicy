Purpose: 
The purpose of the Water Management Plan (WMP) is  
• to perform a thorough assessment of the delivery methods of potable and domestic hot water systems to establish 
and maintain a utility systems management program and 
• to reduce the risk of hospital acquired illness by preventing and controlling waterborne healthcare associated 
infections through an inter-disciplinary approach of system design, system inspection, and clinical surveillance.  
 
Policy 
Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) is mandated to develop and adhere to policies and procedures 
that inhibit microbial growth in building water systems that reduce the risk of growth and spread of legionella and other 
opportunistic pathogens in water.   
 
Legionnaires’ disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused by bacteria called Legionella that live in water.  Legionella 
can make people sick when they inhale contaminated water from building water systems that are not adequately 
maintained. 
 
Program Elements 
A. Water Management Team (WMT) 
1. WMT Members include: 
• Facilities Management 
• Infection Prevention Nurse 
• Contractor Plant Manager 
• Regulatory Outcomes Analyst 
• Regulatory Program Manager 
• Plant Services Master Plumber 
• Water Testing Specialists 
• BioMed Equipment Director 
• Construction Representative  
 
2. WMT will: 
• Be familiar with the building water systems 
• Identify  
• Control Points: Locations in the building water system where a control measure can be applied  
• Control Measures: Actions performed in building water systems to limit growth and spread of 
waterborne pathogens, such as heating, adding disinfectant, or cleaning 
• Control Limits: The maximum value, minimum value, or range of values that are acceptable for the 
control measures that is monitored to reduce the risk for waterborne pathogen growth and spread 2 
o Water source: the points at which water exits from all potable and non-potable building water 
systems, fixtures, and equipment 
• Identify and take Corrective Actions  
• Actions taken to reestablish control when monitoring or measurement values are outside control 
limits 
• Monitor and document program performance 
• Communicate with pertinent departments within the facility and outside the facility, as needed 
• Oversee the program 
• Access necessary resources to implement changes 
• Eliminate dead legs and stagnant water, where possible.  During construction, renovation or department 
shutdowns, flushing of water lines performed regularly and before units are reopened. 
• Dead legs:  Piping that is subject to low or no flow due to design or decreased water use such as 
capped pipes or unused faucets 
• Stagnation:  When water does not flow well; areas of stagnant water encourage biofilm growth and 
reduce temperature and level of disinfectant 
 
B. Building Water Systems  
1. Building Water Systems include hot and cold potable water systems and non-potable water systems in the 
building or on the site.   
• Potable water:  Hot or cold water intended for human consumption, such as drinking, bathing, showering, 
hand washing, teeth brushing, food preparation, and maintaining oral hygiene 
• Non-potable water:  Water not intended for human consumption 
 
2. Building water system components may include: 
• Local or point-of-use temperature mixing valves 
• Water storage tanks 
• Eye wash and safety showers 
• Faucets with flow restrictors 
• Electronic or sensor faucets 
• Floor drains 
• Expansion tanks 
• Backflow / cross connection prevention 
 
3. The water system’s flow diagrams including text descriptions and information regarding the applicable control 
points for these locations are found in Appendix 2.   
• These Control Points may include: 
o Building Water Systems 
o Cooling Towers 
o Emergency Showers and Eyewashes 
o Ice Machines 
o Condensate Trays 
o Decorative Fountains 
o Scheduled or unscheduled water disruptions 
o Sink Faucets/Shower Heads 
o Humidifiers   
o Medical Equipment such as used for Dialysis (See Appendix 3) 
o Sterilizers and/or Reprocessors 
  
C. Potable Water System Monitoring 
1. Preventative Measures 
• No aerators on faucets in patient rooms and nursing units. Where aerators and laminar flow are present, 
scheduled cleaning by department and included in plant services zone inspection; replaced as necessary.  3 
• Shower heads and handheld showers are cleaned by housekeeping during room turn over and included in 
Plant Services zone inspection; replaced as necessary. 
 
2. Monitoring Control Limits and Control Measures 
• Hot water temperature at water source:  Water heaters are set to deliver a maximum temperature of 120°F.  If 
temperatures are found to be out of range, Facilities will mitigate the issue by making the proper adjustments.   
• Free chlorine at water source:  A minimum of 0.2 ppm free chlorine should be maintained at water sources to 
prevent the growth and spread of Legionella and other waterborne pathogens  
• Visual inspection of cleanliness  
• pH:  The pH will be monitored as a means of monitoring fluctuations in water quality.  Disinfectants are most 
effective within a narrow range (6.5 to 8.5) 
• Environmental testing for microorganisms such as Legionella 
 
3. Frequency of monitoring and routine sampling 
• Sampling frequency – Quarterly, scheduled, or non-scheduled disruptions, based on risk 
• Sampling locations – A minimum of 10 random sites should be tested quarterly 
• Sampling methods – Water samples will be tested as defined by the CDC 
• Who will take the samples – Southwest Engineers representative 
 
4. Responding to detections of microorganisms in water sample(s) - If found during environmental validation 
testing, notification and corrective actions will be sent to the following:

E. Clinical Awareness 
1. Higher waterborne pathogen risk areas are identified.  These higher risk areas constitute control locations or 
points in the system where a control measure may be desirable. 
 
The Water Management Team has reviewed the following:  
• The history of documented hospital-acquired infections.  
• Areas in the hospital where high risk patients are likely to be housed and treated and have determined that 
the following four risk group areas exist:  
▪ Highest Risk: Invasive procedure areas and critical care units  
 
▪ Medium-High Risk:  Patient care units and minimally invasive procedure areas 
 
▪ Medium Risk: Outpatient care areas  
 
▪ Low Risk: Non patient care areas 
 
• For patients who are identified in the “Medium-High” and “Highest” risk categories due to medical 
diagnosis, special precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of contracting waterborne pathogens. 
Special patients, who are identified as extremely high risk due to their condition, will have individualized 
care plans that include specific treatment modalities to minimize patient harm.  6 
 
2. Responding to cases of Legionnaires’ disease - If diagnostic testing determines that any case of pneumonia is 
caused by any species of Legionella that is epidemiologically linked to the building:  
• Notification and reporting to Louisiana Department of Health in accordance with the Louisiana Sanitary 
Code. 
• Collect environmental water samples from the hot and cold-water distribution loops in at least the areas 
where the patient had contact with the building water distribution systems. 
• Perform corrective actions which may include decontaminating the building water systems 
• Re-validate with environmental testing 
• Review the WMP and revise, if necessary 
 
F. Program Review  
1. The Water Management Team will review the elements of your program at least annually. We will also 
review and revise the program when any of the following events occur:  
• Data review shows control measures are persistently outside of control limits  
• A major maintenance or water service change occurs, such as: new construction  
• Equipment changes (e.g., new hot tub chlorinator pump)  
• Changes in treatment products (e.g., disinfectants)  
• Changes in water usage (e.g., high and low patient census and unit closures)  
• Changes in the municipal water supply  
• One or more cases of disease are thought to be associated with your system(s)  
• Changes occur in applicable laws, regulations, standards, or guidelines  
• New models or changes to plumbing fixtures are installed within the facilities 
 
2. If an event triggers you to review and update your water management program, remember to:  
• Update the process flow diagram, associated control points, control limits, and corrective actions  
• Update the written description of your building water systems  
• Train those responsible for implementing and monitoring the updated program
