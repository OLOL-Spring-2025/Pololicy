Pressure Injury Prevention Guidelines 
A. For patients with a Braden score of ≤ 18 implement the following pressure injury prevention 
measures:  
• Initiate POC for Skin Integrity Impairment Prevention with goals and interventions  
• Maintain head of bed at or below 30 degrees or at lowest degree of elevation consistent 
with the patient’s medical condition 
• Limit linen layers to 4 (linen includes sheets, blue incontinent pads and/or briefs) 
• Turn every 2 hours 
• Reposition in chair every hour 
• Moisturize skin daily after bath 
• Apply Protective Ointment BID and with each episode of incontinence 
• Remove/reposition medical devices (i.e. SCD, TED, knee immobilizers, nasal cannula, heel 
boots) every shift and assess skin 
• Educate patient and family/caregiver on positioning and off-loading pressure 
• Relieve pressure: 
a. Heel - heel lift boots is best practice, floating heels (for short term) should be on a 
pillow with heels suspended 
b. Sacrum - wedge is best practice when turning to ensure that pressure is relieved 
from bony prominences  
c. Use offloading cushion in  chair  
• Request nutrition consult if patient not eating at least 75% of meals 
B. For patients with a Braden score of ≤ 14 implement the following additional pressure injury 
prevention measures: 
• Request nutrition consult if patient not eating at least 50% of meals 
• Low air loss surface/microclimate management if appropriate 
• PUP dressing, if continent, instead of Protective Ointment 
C. For critical care patients, all interventions are initiated with Braden score of ≤ 18
