Introduction - 
FMOL performs “Self – Auditing” of Medicare Short Stay Inpatient admissions to determine if 
Inpatient level of care was medically necessary.   
 
Process/Procedures –  
A. Upon import to the billing system, Medicare Short Stay Inpatients claims are routed to 
the Revenue Management Self Audit queue for review and determination. 
B. If deemed inappropriate for Inpatient level of care by Revenue Management, the 
account is documented in Rumba, and assigned to Collector ID – AB by the Biller, for AB 
Rebill. 
C. The following is placed in the billers note on the electronic claim: 
“Not appropriate for inpatient. per Dr. Lieux (Remove reference of Physician).  Please bill 
Part B” 
D. The claim will be reassigned to the billers queue.  The note is clearly seen by the biller in 
the billing queue.  Also, when the claim is validated the following warning is given to the 
biller: “270210 CUSTOM WARNING: Short stay visit needs review.  Route to appropriate 
Denials Analyst”. 
E. The biller will review the note and change insurance verification screens making 
Medicare Part A not effective, and order rebill.  
F. Once the “no pay” claim is final, submit all A/B rebilling claims. When the remittance 
advice comes back with a $0 payment, post a concurrent review denial write-off for the 
amount of the Room & Board charges.  Concurrent review write-off code = 00124022, 
transaction type A1. 
G. Submit a rebill for Part B charges.  Details are listed on the following pages.

BILL TYPE 110 
After Inpatient level of care was found to be inappropriate, and in order to receive payment 
under Medicare Part B (AB Rebill), a no-pay claim (TOB 110) must be submitted to Medicare 
Part A.  Medicare will process claim for a zero payment.  Once this is finalized, then AB Rebilling 
can begin.

• Submit bill type 110 for total charges 
• Occurrence span code M1 (Provider Liability)

• All diagnosis codes 
• All procedure codes 
• Remarks – Claim has been self-audited by facility 
• All previously paid 11X TOBs must be adjusted as a “no pay” claim following the steps 
above.  Once the “no pay” claim is final, submit all A/B rebilling claims.

SELF ADMINISTERED DRUGS 
AB Rebill Process Only 
Self-Administered drugs include, but are not limited to ophthalmic ointments, anti-biotic 
ointments, topical solutions, any oral pills, tablets, or medications given to a patient for 
continued use at home after he leaves the hospital. 
For AB Rebills only, self- administered drugs charges will not be billed to the patient. 
Rationale:  The patient was not notified in advance that he was not going to be an Inpatient, 
therefore was not anticipating these additional charges. 
 
Self-administered drug charges should be written off to regular Medicare contractual. 
Medicare Part B outpatient contractual = 00112201 
Medicare Part B manual contractual = 00112018 
 
*Self-Administered drugs will be billed on all other outpatient claim types other than AB Rebills.

NO MEDICARE PART B COVERAGE 
 
Situation:  The admission is deemed inappropriate for inpatient admission.  The patient has no 
Medicare Part B coverage to proceed with regular AB Rebill process. 
 
Process: 
• Medicare Part A should be billed for a zero payment (TOB 110) 
• If the patient has a supplemental insurance, or Medicaid: 
o Submit claim to the supplemental insurance or Medicaid for total charges, with 
proof of Medicare Part A denial.  In “remarks field” indicate no Medicare Part B 
coverage.  This claim may need to be faxed directly to Medicare via secure fax.  If 
supplemental insurance denies payment, this will become a patient 
responsibility. 
• If the patient has no supplemental insurance, or Medicaid: 
o Medicare guidelines state that the patient will become responsible when there is 
no Medicare Part B coverage.  FMOL will bill the patient for all charging that 
would have been eligible for billing under Medicare Part B.   
o Patient responsibility – Patient inquiries regarding this type of patient balance, 
can be discussed with management on a case by case basis for the possibility of 
asettlement offer or charitable guideline assistance. 
o The patient will be screened for financial assistance.
