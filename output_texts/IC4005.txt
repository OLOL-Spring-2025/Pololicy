PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this policy is to standardize the method by which an outbreak is managed. 
 
POLICY: 
An outbreak investigation may be performed when healthcare associated infections or adverse events 
occur above the background rate or when an unusual microbe or adverse event is recognized. 
Although outbreaks are generally divided into steps, it is important to remember that they do not unfold 
in a linear or orderly manner. It is possible that not all the steps will be applicable, and many steps may 
occur simultaneously.  
 
PROCEDURE: 
A. Recognition of a potential outbreak 
1. Cluster: an aggregation of cases grouped by time and place that may be greater than the 
expected number, whether the expected number is known or not; also referred to as a 
small outbreak. 
2. Outbreak: an increase in the occurrence of cases of infection or disease over what is 
expected in a defined setting or group in a specified time period; synonym of epidemic 
but used more often when limiting the geographic area.  
3. Pseudo-outbreak: an increase in positive culture results without evidence of disease, 
frequently attributed to contaminated specimen collection, lab reporting inaccuracies, and 
bias. 
B. Outbreak Investigation 
1. Confirming the presence of an outbreak 
2. Verify the diagnosis 
3. Construct a working case definition 
4. Alerting administration and key healthcare partners about the investigation 
5. Find cases systematically and record information 
6. Observe and review potentially implicated patient care activities 
7. Perform descriptive epidemiology 
8. Hypothesis 
a. Develop hypothesis 
b. Evaluate hypothesis epidemiologically 
c. As necessary, reconsider, refine, and re-evaluate hypothesis
