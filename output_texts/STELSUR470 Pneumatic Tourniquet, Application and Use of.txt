Purpose:   
To provide guidelines for proper use, care of, and application of pneumatic tourniquets. The purpose of a tourniquet 
is to obtain a near bloodl ess field for extremity surgery,  or to confine a bolus of anesthetic in an extremity for 
intravenous regional anesthesia (bier block). 
 
Policy: 
Patient safety and outcomes should be the primary consideration in evaluation, selection and use of the pneumatic 
tourniquet.  The pneumatic tourniquet an d its accessories should be inspected, tested and 
maintained according to manufacturers’ instructions.   
 
Responsibility: 
Surgical Services Personnel, Physicians, Surgeons, Anesthesia 
 
Procedure: 
 
1.   Placement of the pneumatic tourniq uet cuff is performed by the RN, physician’s assistant, or physician 
under the supervision and intra-operative order of the surgeon utilizing the following principles:   
a. Cuff length and width should be appropriate to the size of the extremity. 
b. The cuff should be positioned at the point of maximum circumference of the limb unless instructed 
by surgeon. 
c. Lower extremity tourniquets shall be applied to the proximal third of the thigh. 
d.      Selection and placement of the tourniquet cuff should be determined by the patient's age, anatomy and 
          medical condition. 
 
 
2. Tourniquets are tested/calibrated regularly before use, during use and maintained in working order. 
a. Biomedical Department shall check tourniquets according to manufacturer’s suggestions. 
The results shall be recorded by Biomedical Department. 
b.  Tourniquets will perform a self-check when turned on.  If the equipment does not pass the

self-check, remove from service. 
  
3.    P rotect the patient's skin with cotton cast padding or stockinette by wrapping it around the extremity. The 
tourniquet is applied directly over the padding avoiding wrinkles. The widest cuff possible, based on   appropriate 
tourniquet length shall be selected taking into consideration the size and shape of the patients’    limb and specific 
demands of the procedure.  The cuff should overlap at least three inches but not more   than six inches. To improve 
tourniquet positioning on an obese extremity, an assistant can manually grasp   the adipose tissue of the extremity 
and gently apply and hold traction distal to the tourniquet site until the    padding and cuff are placed.  Traction 
should be maintained until the cuff is secured. 
 
4.       To drain the venous blood from the limb (exsanguinate), the extremity is elevated and wrapped with an 
Esmark or ace bandage; by physician, and the tourniquet is then inflated according to physician’s order. 
 
5. Care must be exercised to prevent the pooling of solutions under the tourniquet to prevent skin injury .     
Cover the tourniquet and extremity with an impervious barrier. 
 
6. Once applied do not rotate or reposition the tourniquet cuff to a new position. 
 
7. The use of a tourniquet is contraindicated in patients with vascular disease or poor peripheral circulation. 
Notify the surgeon of pre-existing conditions. 
 
8. The duration and pressure of tourniquet time is determined by the surgeon. The surgeon is notified of 
tourniquet time at the end of one hour, and at requested designated intervals thereafter. 
 
9. The nurse documents: 
a. Cuff location, and size 
b. Skin protection (e.g., padding, stockinette lining), 
c. Cuff pressure with an intraoperative physician order 
d. Time of inflation and deflation, 
e. Skin and tissue integrity under the cuff before and after use of the pneumatic tourniquet, 
f. Identification number of the tourniquet unit 
g. Identification of the person who applied the cuff.
