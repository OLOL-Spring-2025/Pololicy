members, managers and administrators address ethical questions, concerns and conflicts that may 
arise during hospitalization. 
 
• Anyone may request ethics consultation at any time. Team members and physicians should 
attempt and document routine ways of solving problems or resolving conflicts before 
requesting ethics consultation. 
• Calls after 6 pm are usually answered the next day. The service is also available immediately for 
situations that cannot wait. 
 
• An ethicist or a trained consultation team member assesses each request, and decides whether 
or not to convene a full consultation. Ethics consultation includes active listening, fact 
finding, informed guidance and recommendations.  Consultants attend to the patient's values, 
professional standards and to the medical center's Catholic identity. Results are documented in 
the patient's medical record. 
• Consultants' conclusions are only advisory. Patients, families, surrogates, clinicians and 
administrators remain the decision makers.
