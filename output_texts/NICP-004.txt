PURPOSE: 
The purpose of the policy is to provide a standard approach for nursing management of the newborn thermal 
environment. 
POLICY: 
It is the policy of the Neonatal unit that temperature in the neonates should be measured via the axillary route.  For 
full term neonates the temperature should be 36.5° C – 37.4° C (97.7° F – 99.5° F).   
 
Infants on radiant warmers must be maintained on patient control mechanism with a temperature probe.  A 
reflective patch should cover the temperature probe. 
Infants on Omni Bed or incubator may be cared for in either patient-controlled mode or air-controlled mode.  
Infants weighing less than 1500 grams should be maintained on patient-controlled mode.  
 
PROCEDURE: 
A.  Initiation of Thermoregulation 
1. On admission, identify the appropriate bed for the infant based on weight and physiologic needs. 
2. For infants on radiant warmer or incubator, monitor temperature hourly frequently during stabilization.  
Assess the need for humidification for infants weighing less than 1,200 grams or younger than 30 – 32 
weeks gestation. 
3. If a temperature probe is required to maintain axillary temperature between 36.5° C and 37.5° C, secure 
the probe to the infant with a reflective probe cover.  Probe site should be rotated every 12 hours. 
4. Keep portholes on incubator closed except when providing direct patient care.  Work through portholes 
whenever possible without opening the incubator door.   
5. For infants weighing less than 1,200 grams particularly when humidity has been added to the incubator 
or Omni Bed, the heat boost feature of the Giraffe Omni Bed may be used to further maintain and 
conserve environment heat.  
 
B.  Weaning from the incubator or Omni Bed 
1. When the infant is medically stable, they may be dressed with a cap, shirt, and diaper. 
2. Start weaning temperature at 38° C and wean by 0.5° C with touch times as tolerated. 
3. Once at 28° C open crib top.  Maintain at 28° C for 24 hours and then may transition to open crib. 
4. When a premature infant has an order from physician or NNP or can maintain a stable axillary  
      temperature, weighs more than 1,500 grams, exhibit 5 days of consistent weight gain, and has a stable  
      incubator temperature, the infant may be weaned from the incubator.       
3.  Once the infant has transitioned to the open crib, it should be maintained in a draft-free area. 
4.  Check temperature hourly after placing infant in open crib until two consecutive readings of 36.5° C  
     axillary is obtained. NICP-004

5.  Add additional blankets if necessary. 
6.  If infant temperature is lower than 36° C more than 1 hour after adding second blanket, consider  
     returning to incubator. 
a. Reconsider weaning to an open crib after 24 – 72 hours of stable temperature based on 
physician/NNP order. 
7.  Do not bathe infant on first day in open crib. 
8.  On second and third day in open crib:  Assess & document temperature with each touch time and  
      perform daily weight.  Report any weight loss to physician/NNP.
