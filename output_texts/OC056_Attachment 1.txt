DETERMINATION OF DEATH BY NEUROLOGICAL CRITERIA IN ADULTS 
PHYSICIAN PROGRESS NOTE 
 
 
PREREQUISITES:  The following criteria must be met prior to performing the neurologic examination and apnea test for declaration of death: 
Check appropriate response: Yes No 
1. Coma, irreversible, and cause known   
2. Core body temperature at least 36 degrees Celsius    
3. Systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg   
4. No spontaneous respirations   
5. Patient 18 years of age or older   
6. Absence of medication or ingestant effect    
7. Absence of residual effect of paralytic drug (if indicated, use peripheral nerve stimulator)   
8. Absence of severe acid-base, electrolyte or endocrine abnormality   
If yes to all of the above, proceed with the Neurologic Examination and Apnea Test.   
In the presence of a confounding variable (“NO” to items 6, 7, or 8 above) brain death may still be determined through an ancillary test. 
 
NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:   Check appropriate response. Yes No Unable to Complete 
(Note Reason) 
Absence of pupillary reflex    
Absence of corneal reflex    
Absence of oculocephalic reflex (test only when cervical spine fracture or instability absent)    
Absence of oculovestibular reflex    
Absence of facial movement to noxious stimuli to supraorbital nerve or temporomandibular joint    
Absence of gag reflex    
Absence of cough reflex    
Absence of motor response to noxious stimuli in all 4 limbs (spinally-mediated reflexes are permissible)    
 
APNEA TEST: 
• Prerequisite: patient to meet criteria 1-5 above and have a positive fluid balance for the last 6 hours. 
• If during the apnea test, the patient’s systolic blood pressure drops below 90 mm Hg, oxygen saturation drops below 80 percent, there is a new onset of 
cardiac arrhythmias, cyanosis, or hemodynamic instability, immediately draw an arterial blood sample and place the patient back on the ventilator.   
• Apnea is present if there is absence of respiratory movement and the CO2 is above 60mmHg (from baseline CO2 of 35 to 45mmHg) or increased by 
20mmHg over the baseline reading.  
• If the blood gas values do not meet the criteria, the apnea test is indeterminate and additional confirmatory testing with ancillary tests should be performed. 
CO2 at beginning of apnea test: __________          Apnea Duration: __________          CO2 at end of apnea test: __________ 
Apnea test confirmatory (circle appropriate response) YES NO 
Unable to Complete Apnea Test due to: 
 
ANCILLARY TESTING: Is required when 1) any component of the neurological examination or apnea testing cannot be completed, 2) there is uncertainty about 
the results of the neurological examination, or 3) presence of a confounding variable:  
a. Absence of cerebral blood flow:  Yes No    (please circle)    Date_____/_____/________ Time_________ 
 
I certify that my examination is consistent with irreversible total cessation of function of the brain and/or brainstem.  The patient is declared dead.

DECLARATION OF CANDIDACY OF PERSON FOR ORGAN DONATION BY SECOND PHYSICIAN: Patient meets the medical criteria for death by neurological 
criteria and is a candidate for organ donation.
