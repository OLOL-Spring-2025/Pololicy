PURPOSE 
To further its compliance efforts, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) should be 
fully informed about any pending third party inquiries, including governmental investigations 
concerning the hospital when contacts have been made to hospital employees.   
 
POLICY 
OLOL expects its employees to immediately inform the Corporate Compliance Officer, Chief Legal 
Counsel or the Director of Internal Audit after receiving a contact from any outside investigator or 
auditor, including governmental agencies that are or may be conducting an investigation of the hospital.  
These contacts could occur either while the employee is working at the hospital or during off-hours at 
the employee’s home. 
 
During a governmental investigation by agencies such as the Office of Inspector General, the 
Department of Defense and the United States Attorney’s Office, an employee may have legal 
representation. 
 
This policy is not meant to in any way deter OLOL employees from cooperating or assisting with any 
investigator, auditor or federal or state agent conducting investigations.
