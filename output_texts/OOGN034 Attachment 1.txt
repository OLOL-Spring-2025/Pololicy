Ethical and Religious 
Directives for Catholic 
Health Care Services  
Normative Principle 1; Catholic health care ministry is rooted in a commitment to promote and 
defend human dignity; this is the foundation of its concern to respect the sacredness of every 
human life. 
Normative Principle 3:  Catholic health care ministry seeks to contribute to the common good.  
The common good is realized when economic, political and social conditions ensure protection 
for the fundamental rights of all individuals and enable all to fulfill their common purpose and 
reach their common goals.  
Directive 2: Catholic healthcare should be marked by a spirit of mutual respect among caregivers 
that disposes them to deal with those it serves and their families with the compassion of Christ, 
sensitive to their vulnerability at a time of special need. 
Directive 3:  In accord with its mission, Catholic health care should distinguish itself by service to 
and advocacy for those people whose social condition puts them at the margins of our society 
and makes them particularly vulnerable to discrimination: the poor, the uninsured and the 
underinsured; the unborn; single parents; those with incurable diseases and chemical 
dependencies; racial minorities, immigrants and refugees.  In particular the person with mental or 
physical disabilities regardless of the cause or severity must be treated as a unique person of 
incomparable worth, with the same right to life and to adequate health care as all other persons.  
Directive 7: A Catholic health care institution must treat its employees respectfully and justly.  
This responsibility includes: equal employment opportunities for anyone qualified for the task 
irrespective of a person’s race, sex, age, national origin, or disability; a workplace that promotes 
employee participation; a work environment that ensures employee safety and well -being; just 
compensation and benefits; and recognition of the rights of employees.  
Directive 9:  Employees of a Catholic health care institution must respect and uphold the religious 
mission of the institution and adhere to these Directives. They should maintain professional 
standards and promote the institution’s commitment to human dignity and the common good.   
Directive 23:  The inherent dignity of the human person must be respected and protected 
regardless of the nature of the person’s health problem or social status.  The respect for human 
dignity extends to all persons who are served by Catholic health care.

organizational chart is approved by the President and published as deemed necessary by changes in the organization.  
 
▪ At least one member of the Administrative Staff will be "on-call" and available at all times.

appropriate person when the need arises.

treatment.

effective communication with the employee. 
 
▪ Both the employee and supervisor may enlist the assistance of the Human Resources Department as a resource to aid in resolvin g 
problems.

exhausted.

Step 1 
▪ The employee submits the problem in writing to the Vice President of Human Resources within two weeks of the event 
in question.

the employee feels appropriate for resolving the problem. 
 
Step 2 
▪ The Vice President of Human Resources (or an appointee) will conduct investigations and interview persons needed to 
aid in clarification of the matter.   
▪ Additionally, the employee may be asked to provide additional information used to clarify matters raised in the 
investigation.

b) accept a transfer to another position within the hospital where the supervisory -level employee will not, directly or
