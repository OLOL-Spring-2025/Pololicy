The employee health record is a confidential document, access to which shall be restricted to the 
employee, the employee health physician, and the employee health staff members with a legitimate need

that the information contained in the medical record is private and confidential and shall not be disclosed 
except in certain "limited circumstances":

claim). 
 
2. The following types of medical information may be routinely disclosed without the employee's 
consent to persons with a "need to know": 
 
 a. specific information required under federal, state, or local laws 
 b. recommendations, without any of the underlying medical data, concerning medical 
limitations pertaining to the employee's performance of duties of a particular job.

apart from employee personnel files.  Such files (employee health record) shall be located in the 
Employee Health Department and be maintained in a secure environment. 
 
2. The employee health records shall be maintained in a secure environment, which is under the 
direct supervision of and in close proximity to the employee health staff.  Employee health records 
shall be accessible by the employee health staff during regular business hours and secured at the
