Purpose: 
 
◼ To ensure the functional integrity of smoke/ fire walls within hospital facilities 
 
 
Policy: 
 
Any person or persons working for, or on behalf of, or within the hospital is required to notify the 
Plant Services Office before any work is done above any ceiling of any building  containing 
smoke/fire walls which is  owned by Our Lady of the Lake Ascension and must receive an “Above-
Ceiling Permit” prior to commencing any above -ceiling work.  Additionally, any person or persons 
penetrating or damaging any smoke/fire wall in conjunction with their work will repair the 
smoke/fire wall and replace/repair ceilings before release of final payment is made for their 
services or work. 
 
 
Procedure: 
 
Any department contracting for above-ceiling work will info rm perspective bidders of our  above-
ceiling work policy, and their need to obtain a permit should they be awarded the contract.  The 
permit package to be obtained from Plant Services before the work can commence will consist of 
the numbered permit and a floor plan , both of which will  include pertinent information about the 
scope of work, route, and special precautions to be taken. 
 
The completed permit information will be reviewed by Plant Operations, and the permit will then be 
signed and given to the contractor.  The contractor will post the permit in the most prominent 
place at the work site and ensure that each of his workers always wear their company identification 
badges while work is being done.  Anyone who is working abov e the ceiling without a badge and  
permit will be asked by hospital personnel to stop work immediately and will not be allowed to 
restart until the proper permit is obtained from the Plant Operations Dept.

the jobsite will ensure that fire/smoke wall integrity has been maintained, that all trash and debris 
is removed from the space, and that the ceiling grid and tiles are intact and in place.  Any 
necessary repairs to fire/smoke walls will be done in such a way, with approved materials, that the 
integrity of the wall is maintained. 
 
Once the designated Plant Operations employee has inspected and accepted the work performed, 
the permit will be closed  out.  The contr actor will return the  permit to Pla nt Operations for 
completion, at which time the designated Plant Operations employee will sign the permit, indicating 
his approval for the Accounting Department to pay the contractor’s invoice for the work completed. 
 
A log of all permits will be kept on file in the Plant Operations office for historical reference. 
 
Contractors working in designated construction areas will be exempt from the permitting process.   
However, if their work requires them to go outside the designated area, the permitting policy will 
be enforced.

ABOVE-CEILING PERMITS 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS 
 
1) Statement of Tools and Equipment 
 
 All contractors will provide all their own tools and equipment necessary to accomplish the 
permitted work to be done.  The Plant Operations Department will NOT loan any tools or 
equipment to a contractor, so please DO NOT ASK.  Acceptable workmanship and standard 
practices shall not be compromised as a result of a contractor  not having the proper tools or 
equipment. 
 
2) Proper Use of Permits and Badges 
 
 The permit will be displayed in the most conspicuous place in the area of work being 
performed.  In addition to having the permit displayed, each worker on the project m ust 
wear a company identification badge .  Plant Operations personnel have been instructed to 
assist the contract person and  monitor the work being performed.  Any contractor observed 
performing work above the ceiling without a proper company identification badge or a 
permit will be stopped immediately and not allowed to continue until the proper permit or 
I.D. badge is obtained.  If the contractor then attempts to proceed with above-ceiling work 
without getting the permit and receiving authorization to resume work , the contractor and 
his workers will be escorted from the building by Security. 
 
3) Precautions to Take in Sensitive Areas 
 
 There are certain sensitive areas in the hospital where special precautions must be taken 
when work is being performed in them.   A few of the areas such as the Operation Rooms 
and Critical Care areas require special clothing and work practices.  Plant Operations 
management will advise you of any special conditions or precautions that may be required.  
This is the reason you have been requested to outline the area of work and route you intend 
to use to accomplish your task.  It is important that there are no deviations in the route or 
area.  If you must alter eithe r the route or area, inform the  Plant Services Department  
BEFORE proceeding. 
 
4) Actions to Take During a Fire Drill or Disaster Drill 
 
 Our Lady of the Lake Ascension  conducts regular fire drills and disaster drills.  Contractors 
are expected to the following during any of these drills: 
 
                 During a fire drill  you should hear  the fire alarm syste m sound and/or the PBX 
operator announcing “Code Red” and the location will be given.  When e ither of these 
two things occur, anyone working above the ceiling is to come down  immediately.  All 
ladders, tools, and equipment shall be placed on one side of the corridor.  Contractors  
should then wait by their equipment until the “ Code Red all clear” is announced, or 
instructions are received from hospital personnel. 
 
Above-Ceiling Permits – General Information for Contractors

          During a disaster drill the operator will announce “Code Gray” (Severe Weather), 
          “Code Yellow” (Mass Casualty), “Code Orange” (Chemical Contamination) over the  
          PBX  system.  Contractors should follow the same guidelines as for a fire drill. 
 
5) General Work Standards and Exceptions the Contract Person Must Observe 
 
 Contractors/workers are to be aware of all permit rules and regulations. 
  
 All wiring must be attached appropriately to “j -type hooks” or similar devices and strapped 
together with Ty-wraps. NOTHING can be attached to the sprinkler  pipes or laying across 
them. 
 
 Any damage done to the ceiling or any part of the building as a result of work being 
performed shall be fixed and the damaged area will be returned to the original or “like new” 
condition at the contractor’s expense. 
 
 All penetrations through fire/smoke walls shall be repaired with appropriate fire caulk or 
their UL labeled products.  The repairs made shall match or surpass the rating of the wall.  A 
designated Plant Operations employee shall have final authority as to the acceptance of a 
repair through a fire/smoke wall. 
 
 While working in corridors and hallways, all ladders, tools, and equipment shall be ke pt to 
one side of the corridor/hallway and as close to the wall as possible paying close attention to  
team members and guests. 
 
 Extension cords are never to be run across a corridor.  They must always follow the wall on 
the side where work is being done and be plugged into the nearest outlet on that side. 
 
 No trash, construction debris or any other material shall be left in the ceiling.  If your work 
area has debris in it before work begins, notify the Plant Operations Department 
management personnel and inform them  of such trash/debris or it will be assumed to be 
yours.  Should there be a spill of any liquid, it is to be cleaned up immediately.  In addition, 
all ceiling tiles shall be put back in place when the contractor leaves a work area. 
 
    
 Anytime there is an open flame from a torch or any other device, a fire -watch will be 
established with appropriate extinguisher at the site of the work and a “Hot Works” permit is 
also required. 
 
 Your Plant Operations Department contact will show you where to store materials.  Please 
store them in the designated area ONLY.

 It shall be the contractor’s responsibility to provide for all trash removal and clean -up.  No 
trash or debris of any kind shall be left in the hospital or above the ceiling line.  The area 
where the work is being performed will be expected to look as good, or better, than before 
the work started.  Any trash or debris resulting from the work being performed should be 
cleaned up immediately, while the work is still on -going.  Your designated Plant Operations 
contact will show you where to dispose of trash/debris.

 Your Plant Operations contact person will show you where parking is allowed.  Please park in 
the designated spots ONLY.

Plant Operations employee will do a final inspection of the work performed  and the permit  
and map will be surrendered to him for completion.   After the Plant Operations employee 
has inspected and accepted the work performed , he  will sign the permit, indicating his
