PURPOSE: To provide written guidelines for prioritizing patients on the admissions waiting list. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
1. Once a patient has been properly referred and accepted for admission, he or she may be placed on a Daily 
Admission Status Report. 
2. The purpose of the waiting list is to permit the staff to give in-patient quality care until a Rehab Center bed is 
available or the patient is deemed appropriate for transfer to the Rehab Center. 
3. The patient and family will be informed by the Rehab Liaison or Physician if they should have to wait to be 
admitted to the Rehab Center.  Every effort is made to continue to provide appropriate services for the patient 
until admission. 
4. Patients are admitted to the first available bed (this could be private or semi-private).  Patients will be 
admitted to a private room.  If the patient desires a larger, private room, then the patient’s name will be given 
to the Charge Nurse / Nurse Manager to be placed on a waiting list for the first available private room.  
Priority for large, private room assignment goes to those patients whom the physician deems medically 
necessary. 
5. Decisions as to which patient is admitted first are made based on referral date, medical stability, and 
availability of appropriate bed.
