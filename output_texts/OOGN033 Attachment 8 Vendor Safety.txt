gifts and talents to create a spirit of healing–with reverence and love 
for all of life, with joyfulness of spirit, and with humility and justice for 
all those entrusted to our care. 
 
We are, with God’s help, a healing and spiritual presence for each 
other and for the communities we are privileged to serve.
