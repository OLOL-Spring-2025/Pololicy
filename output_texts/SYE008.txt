PURPOSE:  To define the process for reprocessing and monitoring the cleanliness of duodenoscopes. 
 
POLICY:  Duodenoscopes will be reprocessed according to manufacturer’s IFU. After manual 
cleaning, the biopsy channel and elevator mechanism will be tested for protein prior to high level 
disinfection. Duodenoscopes will be high level disinfected twice. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
1. After use, inspect and manually clean duodenoscope according to manufacturer’s IFU. Inspect 
the elevator in the open and closed position to ensure that no visible debris remains. 
2. When manual cleaning complete, use the protein detection test per IFU to test for bioburden 
(blood, protein, etc.) Proceed to HLD when the protein detection test passes. If fails, manually 
clean again. Re-test. 
3. Proceed to high level disinfection by following AER instruction for use. Inspect and dry scope, 
then purge with air, alcohol, and air per manufacturer’s IFU. Hang and store scope according to
