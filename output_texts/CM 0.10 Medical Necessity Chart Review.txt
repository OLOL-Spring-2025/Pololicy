III. POLICY: 
 The following are guidelines in determining severity of illness and intensity of 
service.  Patents meeting severity of illness and/or intensity of service criteria for 
acute care are appropriate for admission to the acute care area.  If patients do not 
meet severity of illness and/or intensity of service for acute care, other levels of 
care should be considered.  Following case review the care management 
department follows processes in place to notify, communicate, and document all 
commercial and Medicaid authorization information into EPIC.   Ultimately the 
intent to admit lies with the physician and is based on sound clinical judgment 
and appropriate documentation of need including the 2 Midnight statement for 
Medicare beneficiaries as appropriate.

for all inpatient and observation admissions.

Manager / Utilization Review Nurse and/or nursing personnel will contact 
the admitting physician for additional information to be recorded in the medical record. 
3. If severity of illness is still not met, the Care Manager / Utilization Review 
Nurse will contact the Manager/Director of Care Management, Attending 
Physician, Medical Director, Physician Advisor and/or Administration, 
who may also contact any physician on the case for clarification.  Any
