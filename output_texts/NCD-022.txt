Policy:    
 
1. New employees within the hospital should attend OLOL hospital general orientation.  All 
personnel entering into the Cardiovascular Lab should receive an orientation packet.  This 
shall consist of the CVL orientation manual, a schedule of their shift, and an orientation 
checklist and evaluation.  Employees entering the department without prior Cath Lab 
experience will receive a 16-22 week orientation. Upon completion of orientation, the 
employee is responsible for turning in their checklist and evaluation sheet to the Educator. 
 
2. An evaluation will be performed upon successful completion of skills outlined in the 
orientation checklist and a performance review from the preceptors.  If after 22 weeks, the 
employee has not met the requirements of successful completion, the employee's orientation 
process may be extended for further evaluation of their skill level.  After further evaluation, 
the employee must be able to successfully complete orientation.  If an employee is unable to 
do so, Human Resources will be notified for guidance.   
 
3. Employees with previous cardiovascular lab experience will complete a ten to twelve week 
orientation.
