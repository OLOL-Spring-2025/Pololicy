PURPOSE: 
This policy provides guidance on establishing and maintaining a Door Inspection program in order to 
provide a fire-safe, functional and effective environment for staff, occupants and visitors. 
 
POLICY: 
Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) will contract with a qualified inspector to 
annually inspect fire and smoke doors.   
 
Non-fire and smoke doors are inspected during Plant Services rounding and Environment of Care/Life 
Safety rounding. 
 
Identifying door deficiency training will be held as needed for Plant Services rounding staff. 
 
PROCEDURES: 
Fire and Smoke Doors: 
• OLOL will maintain an inventory of all fire and smoke doors updating inventory as needed.   
• Identified deficiencies are corrected as quickly as possible.  Any deficiencies not corrected 
during the same work shift require an Interim Life Safety Measure. 
• OLOL will maintain documentation of annual fire and smoke door inspections and corrections.
