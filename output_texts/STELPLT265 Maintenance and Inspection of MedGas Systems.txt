Policy:                 The medical gas system is maintained and inspected on a semi-annual basis to monitor  
supply levels as well as ascertain any breach in the system. 
  
  
Applies to:             Plant Operations Department 
  
  
Responsibility:     Plant Operations 
  
Procedure:            1. The normal and reserve supplies of liquid oxygen will be checked at the beginning of   
        each shift (two times daily) and documented on the grand round sheet. Oxygen is   
                                   reordered when the level drops to 45 inches (1500 gallon Main Vessel) and 30 inches   
                                   (120 gallon Reserve Vessel). 
  
2.  The normal and reserve supplies of nitrous oxide are checked at the beginning of each   
     shift (twice daily) and documented on the grand round sheet. Nitrous oxide   
     cylinder banks are replaced when the primary is exhausted and the secondary supply is  
     activated.  
                                 
3. Following periods of construction or evidence that the system has been breached, the   
    medical-gas system will be tested by a certified medical testing vendor to verify that  
    the gases being delivered meet the regulatory requirements. Documentation of such  
    testing will be kept on file in the plant operations department. 
  
4. In accordance with the preventive maintenance procedures for non-flammable  
    anesthetizing locations, critical care areas and general patient care areas, a certified    
    vendor  inspects the wall outlets and makes repairs as needed annually.
