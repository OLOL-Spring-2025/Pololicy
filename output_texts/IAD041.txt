Title: Work on Weekends (WOW) Program Policy Reference #:  IAD041 
Supersedes #:  
Date of Origination: Oct 2023 Last Review Date:  11/23, 2/24 
Last Revision Date: 11-3-23 
 
PURPOSE:  
The purpose of this guideline is to establish a Work on Weekends (WOW) program designed to provide 
a staffing alternative for licensed professional, while continuing to provide quality patient care. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
1. The Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL) employee or applicant being 
considered must meet the following prerequisites for the WOW assignment: 
A. Must have current license/certification in applicable job class.  The following job classes are 
currently included in the WOW program: 
➢ Registered Rad Tech 
➢ Registered Nuclear Medicine Tech 
➢ Registered Ultrasound Tech 
➢ Registered CT Tech 
➢ Registered MRI Tech 
 
B. Completion of transfer request per the established transfer policy. 
C. The employee is not on disciplinary probation. 
 
2. The Department Manager/Director, with approval from his/her Vice President, will determine the 
number of positions available for the WOW program in his/her department. 
 
3. The employee will be given the option to take one weekend every twelfth weekend following eleven 
consecutively worked weekends. 
 
4. The employee will be required to work on holidays that occur on his/her scheduled weekends.  If the 
weekend off falls on a holiday weekend, the WOW employee will work the holiday weekend and 
schedule vacation for the weekend preceding or following the holiday, unless an alternate schedule 
has been approved by the department nursing manager/director.   
 
5. The employee working on weekends will have the last option to be off unless otherwise directed by 
the Nurse Manager/Director.  During times of extended low census, WOW employees will be placed 
in the unit’s cancellation rotation. 
 
6. Being unable to work a scheduled weekend will be considered the employee’s one weekend off for 
the twelve-week period.  If the employee cannot meet the on-going requirements of working eleven 
of every twelve weekends, then he/she will be removed from the WOW program. 
A. The first episode of absence outside of the twelfth weekend off in a twelve-month period 
will result in program probation.   IAD041

B. The second episode of absence outside of the twelfth weekend off in a 12-month period will 
result in removal from the WOW program. 
 
7. Two WOW employees can “swap” scheduled weekends off only if both have submitted and signed 
requests and these requests are approved by the Department Manager / Director.  If either of the 
employees fails to report to work on the affected shift, both employees will receive disciplinary 
action. 
 
8. The WOW employee will receive an hourly base rate pay based on years of experience and a 
premium weekend differential for Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  He/she will receive applicable 
evening, night, and holiday differentials for hours worked on the weekends in this program.   
 
9. A full-time WOW employee will be scheduled to work 32-40 hours per weekend.  The full-time 
WOW employee works three consecutive shifts on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  WOW shifts 
begin at 7am on Friday and end at 7am on Monday.   
 
10. A part-time WOW employee will be scheduled to work 24 hours per weekend, will be classified as a 
0.60 Full-time Equivalent (FTE) and will accrue benefits based on hours worked.  The part-time 
WOW employee works two consecutive 12-hour shifts on Saturday and Sunday (applies to day and 
night WOW).   
 
11. OLOL employees on disciplinary probation or involved in the disciplinary process are NOT eligible 
for this program for twelve months after the beginning of the probation. If a WOW employee is 
placed on disciplinary probation, he/she will no longer be eligible to remain on the WOW program 
for twelve months.  
 
12. The WOW employee’s review date will be consistent with the common review date for his/her 
respective job class and/or department.  Any merit increase recommended in conjunction with the 
review will be added only to the alternate rate of pay.  
 
13. OLOL reserves the right to modify, change or discontinue this program at any time.
