PURPOSE 
To provide consistency in the process of notification to law enforcement when a written request is received. 
 
DEFINITION 
 
Courtesy Discharge – A request from a law enforcement agency requesting notification of a pending discharge 
for a patient who has been issued a summons or arrest warrant for an offense. 
 
POLICY 
A. There are occasions in which a law enforcement agency requests in writing that the facility notify them 
when a patient is discharged or expires. 
 
B. To provide consistency in this process, a Discharge Notification form will be used.  
▪ It is possible that the Law enforcement agency will bring a form with them and we may use that 
instead.  
 
C. Staff members should request this form be completed by the law enforcement agency if one is not 
provided by the law enforcement agency. 
 
D. The Discharge Notification form will then be attached to the medical record throughout the patient’s 
admission. 
 
E. Upon patient’s discharge or death, the requesting agency will be notified within a reasonable time after 
the physician notifies the hospital of the pending discharge or the patient’s death.
